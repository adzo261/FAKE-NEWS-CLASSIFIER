"Longtime mistress says Bill Clinton had 2000 sex partners Hillary is a lesbian It was a marriage of convenience
","Another long-time lover of Bill Clinton has come forth, with a new book, Hillary, The Other Woman (WND Books), spilling beans on his insatiable satyriasis and Hillarys hell-bent political ambitions.

She is Dolly Kyle, an attorney in her 60s, who first met Bill Clinton in Arkansas in the summer of 1959 when she was 11 years old and he 12. Supposedly, it was love at first sight  a sexual relationship that lasted 32 years  through high school (although she says they didnt have sex until after graduation), Bills law school at Yale, his years as Arkansas governor, and until his entrance into the White House.

Dolly Kyle in 1998

Dolly Kyle in 1998

This is what Dolly Kyle wrote in her book (source: Daily Mail):

(1) In 1987, Bill Clinton had had 2,000 sex partners:

Dolly said she started sleeping with Bill after high school and admits Billy was a sex addict; I was a codependent. In 1987, Bill Clinton was undone by Wilt Chamberlains claim to have slept with 20,000 women. Bill told Dolly, Thats ten times more than Ive had!  which meant Bill had sex with 2,000 women in 1987, which means that the number would be even higher by 2016.

Hey, Dolly Kyle, thats some love Bill Clinton had for you!

(2) Bill Clinton had wanted to be president since high school:

Bill first confessed his desire to be president to Dolly back in high school, and began actively pursuing it after the summer of 1963 when, as an Arkansas delegate to Boys Nation, he had a photo-op with President John F Kennedy in the Rose Garden.

(3) Bill Clinton called blacks niggers:

Dolly wrote that she frequently had heard Bill refer to blacks in the South as G**damn n****r.

(4) Bill Clinton never used a condom, but seemingly was unconcerned because, as he told Dolly, he had a low sperm count. (Note: Other reports say Bill Clinton is sterile from mumps.)

(5) It was a marriage of convenience  of Bill and Hillary using each other:

Hillarys role was financial provider to get Bill elected president, and pursue his addictions to politics, power and sex. Bills mother, too, had supported the family financially while his stepfather drank. Dolly wrote: Hillarys role of providing financial security for Billy was part of her motivation for the series of financial crimes (yes, crimes) that she committed over the decades. Hillary was upholding her part of the deal to get Billy elected president, after which it would be her turn to be the first woman in the Oval Office.

(6) Bill Clinton called Hillary his warden:

Hillary kept Bills nose clean in the public mind and had private investigators tracking Bill and the women he was dating or attacking because she was riding his coattails to political power. Dolly writes: Hillary needs the power and she is ruthless.

(7) Hillary was sweaty and had hairy calves and toes:

Dolly first met Hillary on the evening of May 28, 1974 at the airport in Little Rock. It was election night and Senator William Fulbright was running for re-election. Fulright was Bill Clintons champion  giving Bill his first Senate job while Bill attended Georgetown University; supporting him for the Rhodes Scholarship and a teaching job at Arkansas Law School; introducing him to powerful people in Washington and financial backers for Bills first congressional campaign that he eventually lost.

Dolly describes Hillary as a dowdy-looking woman who appeared to be middle-aged with thick eyebrows melded together stretching across her forehead, wearing coke-bottle-thick lenses and a misshapen, brown, dress-like thing that must have been intended to hide her lumpy body. The garment was long, but stopped too soon to hide her fat ankles and her thick calves covered with black hair. Thick brown sandals did nothing to conceal her wide feet and the hair on her toes.

Hillary glared at Dolly with hostility. Dolly writes: In that moment, I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldnt gag when she got in the car. When Bill introduced the dowdy woman as Hillary, Dolly was stunned and thought it was some kind of a sick joke  a woman in a hideous disguise.

(8) Bill discarded his mentor-benefactor Sen. Fulbright when the latter lost reelection:

Dolly writes that although the plan had been to go the Fulbrights campaign headquarters, when the votes came in showing he was losing, Hillary signaled to Bill and the plan was changed. He would head back to the airport. Bill told Dolly, I dont want to be seen with a loser.

(9) Hillarys attempt to carve a political career for herself in Washington sizzled:

A lawyer and graduate of Yale, Hillary wanted a career in Washington but she flunked the DC bar exam. Dolly writes that at the time of her meeting Hillary for the first time, Hillary was working in Washington, DC and trying to become a political force under her own steam. But It was a futile attempt and Hillarys job with the Watergate investigation ended. Dolly believes Hillary showed the same lack of integrity there that would later get her into more serious trouble. (See Hillary Clinton was fired for lying when she was 27 years old)

(10) Hillary was a lesbian:

Although Bill did not use the word lesbian, he hinted at it by keep referring to Hillarys lifestyle.

In March 1979, Bill told Dolly he wanted a child but had a low sperm count: We need to have a baby so we can appear to be a normal couple. We need to do something serious to take attention off the Wardens lifestyle. He asked Dolly to pray for a baby. Dolly suggested he had to bite the bullet and sleep with Hillary. Within a year, Chelsea Victoria Clinton was born and Bill fell head over heels with the little baby. (See Bill Clinton not Chelseas biological father)

But Hillary felt trapped being at home with a baby and couldnt wait to get back to work. She asked her friend, Louise: How long do I have to stay at home with this kid? Hillary stayed home with baby Chelsea for three months before returning to work. Bill told to Dolly that it was the baby that kept the couple together.

(11) Hillarys other attractive qualities:

Hillary resented that she had to dress like Southern women; she visited dress shops but generally didnt buy anything. Dolly also confirms Secret Service agents accounts of Hillarys foul mouth, anger towards the White House and Arkansas governor security detail, and physical abuse of Bill. In Arkansas, she had hissy fits and threw dishes at Bill in the kitchen, breaking a kitchen cabinet door. When Bill lost the governorship after one year, Hillary was furious, knowing that she was no longer the states First Lady and had to move out of the governors mansion and into a tiny house. (See Ex-Secret Service agent: Jekyll & Hyde personality makes Hillary unfit to be President)

Dolly writes: Hillary is not a leader. She is a coattail-clutcher who has a litany of jobs with no accomplishments, having failed as co-president, failed as senator unless you are impressed with the bills she introduced to name a couple of post offices, failed as secretary of state and as a defender of women over the past 40 years. Hillary instigated threats on women who had sex with her husband, a serial sex abuser.

(12) Dollys summary opinion of the Clintons:

Despite her long, 32-year sexual (its true love!) relationship with Bill Clinton, Dolly Kyle has only contempt for the Clintons. She writes:

Billy and Hillary Clinton continue to be lying, cheating, manipulative, scratching, clawing, ruthlessly aggressive, insatiably ambitious politicians who are giving public service a bad name  and nothing about them has changed in the past forty-plus years, except that they have deluded more and more people. The Clintons and their misled supporters have rewritten history to suit their political agenda, which is to get votes to get power to get money to get more power to get more money. The Clintons vicious cycle of intertwining greed and power addictions will have no limit, unless someone stands up and announces. The emperor has no clothes! Ideology, integrity, and love of country were never involved in the Billary quest for the White House. It was always a codependent, co-conspiratorial grab for money and power and more money and more power. Unfortunately for them and for the United States of America, there is never enough to satisfy addicts.",F
"ISIS LEADER CALLS FOR AMERICAN MUSLIM VOTERS TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON
","Top ISIS leader now believed to be the number two behind the terrorist organization, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani, put up a video this week following the second presidential debate asking American Muslim voters to support Hillary Clinton.

The controversial video that was taken down by YouTube only hours after it was uploaded showed top ISIS leader Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani threatening those who would decide to vote for Donald Trump and calling them infidels and goat f-ers.

 All Muslims who will show support for the dog-faced Trump are guilty of masiya (mortal sin) 

 ISIS No.2 leader, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani

He also claimed that even if Hillary was a woman and a two face devil, had the charm of a pig and was treacherous as the snake, that the Democratic presidential hopeful was at least in league with the allied countries of the Islamic state such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Supporting the dog-faced Trump

Al-alwani also warned all Muslims not to take his warnings lightly and that supporters of Trump would be severely punished on earth and in Jannah (afterlife).

Trump is a dog, he is the scum of the earth. He boasts that he will take our oil and join Russia, Syria and the Shia Iranians against us in our holy fight he added, visibly angry.

This (dog-faced) scumbag must not reach Washington. Although it is a sin to put an inferior being such as a woman into a position of power, it is the true plan of Satan to divide the Muslims of America. It would be dirty and danis (filthy) to vote for Trump, he explained.

Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani has risen as a prominent ISIS leader figure since coalition forces carried out a precision strike last August, successfully targeting Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, number two of the terrorist organization at the time.",F
"Donald Trump Caught Snorting Cocaine by Hotel Staff
","The Internet is buzzing today after white supremacist presidential candidate Donald Trump was caught by hotel staff snorting cocaine.

Maria Gonzalez an employee at the Folks INN & Suites Hotel in Phoenix brought room service to his room witnessed it all.

When I walked in I saw 3 naked prostitutes and maybe 100,000 in hundred dollars bills and a mountain of white powder on the table, I thought it was a dog on the floor sleep but it was his hair piece, he was bald and sweating like crazy.

"BREAKING Official Set to Testify Against Hillary Found Dead
","The suspicious circumstances surrounding the death last week of former U.N. President John Ashe had many wondering whether foul play was involved.

The New York Posts Page Six reported that after Ashe was found dead Wednesday, the U.N. claimed that he had died from a heart attack. Local police officers in Dobbs Ferry, New York, later disputed that claim, saying instead that he died from a workout accident that crushed his throat.

Adding to the mysterious nature of Ashes death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court Monday with his Chinese businessman co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, from whom he reportedly received over $1 billion in donations during his term as president of the U.N. General Assembly.

According to an unidentified source who spoke with Page Six, prosecutors had intended to use the latter fact to link Ashe directly to Democrat front-runner Hillary Clinton, with whom he could be seen schmoozing in the picture above.

It would have been very embarrassing, the source added. His death was conveniently timed.

There was no evidence at the moment to corroborate the sources theory of foul play, but that certainly did not stop conspiracy theorists from theorizing about what really happened.

Those theorists inclined to believe the stories about Hillary and Bill Clinton ordering the murders of their opponents wondered whether the former U.N. president was merely their latest victim

However, Ashes own lawyer, Jeremy Schneider, strongly disagreed with these theories.

The late Vince Foster was a deputy White House counsel who died by gunshot in 1993 after he allegedly committed suicide. Conspiracy theorists have maintained for years that his death was in fact a murder  one spearheaded by Hillary Rodham Clinton.

No definitive evidence was ever procured to prove this theory, but that didnt stop them then, and it likely wont stop them now.

"""CANADA READY TO RECEIVE 250
","Ottawa | Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is getting prepared to accommodate nearly 250,000 American refugees if Donald Trump is to be elected US president in November.

Immigration requests exploding

Immigration Canada claims to have received more than 350,000 requests for information on Canadian citizenship status since Super Tuesday when Donald Trump won several important states.

The more Trump advances, the more we are overwhelmed, assures spokesperson for Immigration Canada, Amanda Singh. Our whole 2016 budget is already gone since it was necessary to enroll extra workforce to successfully process all applications and even then, it is far from sufficient for the task she admits, visibly under stress. But Ottawa has promised us its full cooperation on this question, she assured.

"Sauron Endorses Donald Trump for President
","Trump refuses to disavow the Dark Lords support, stirring controversy

MORDOR  Sauron, the fallen Maia best known for engulfing Middle-Earth in two apocalyptic wars, has endorsed real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump for president of the United States. This comes as to shock to those who thought that Sauron was destroyed at the end of the Third Age.

Though Saurons power greatly diminished after the destruction of The One Ring, a fragment of his broken spirit has endured for millennia, and still lurks beneath the ruins of Barad-dr (present-day Gadsden, Alabama). The Dark Lord is currently not powerful enough to assume a physical form, but still has the presence of mind to follow the Republican presidential primaries.

Donald Trump is the only candidate who can fulfill my vision for the future, Sauron said Saturday night in an omnipresent, ethereal whisper. Just as I spread darkness and suffering across Middle-Earth, so shall Trump bring darkness to Middle America.

In many ways, Trump is a natural choice for Sauron. During his tenure as the Dark Lord of Mordor, Sauron enacted or supported numerous controversial policies, including the expansion of torture, the murder of Rohirrim families, and the deportation of 12 million dwarves.

When asked about Sauron on NBCs Meet the Press, Trump seemed hesitant to distance himself from the evil necromancer. I dont think the American people want me to dismiss every Dark Lord before I have a chance to learn more about them, said Trump. I just dont know anything about Sauron or his dark legion of orcs, trolls, and Nazgl; I need to do more research.

Trumps refusal to disavow Saurons support has sparked huge backlash from pundits and fellow presidential candidates, who claim that Trump is himself a lieutenant of the Dark Lord. The Republican frontrunner took to Twitter to refute this claim: Definitely not a follower of Sauron. The palantr in Trump Tower lobby is for decoration only  not for communicating with dark lords!",F
"Donald Trump Hires Clueless Stacey Dash for Negro Outreach Program
","TRUMP TOWER  With his poll numbers among black voters hovering around 1%, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump reportedly tapped actress and FOX News contributor Stacey Dash as his Negro Outreach Program Ambassador.

She connects with that group, said Trump, and shell be terrific. Did you see her at the Oscars? She was terrific as the Minority Outreach Director, so we brought her on board. Were lucky to have her. Shes controversial, but shes one of the good ones.

Dash recently created controversy by calling Greys Anatomy actor Jesse Williams a plantation slave after his BET Awards speech calling for an end to racism and what he called cultural appropriation.

Trump said now more than ever, especially with Crooked Hillary siphoning off my blacks, minority outreach is the difference between winning and losing in November.

You know what will happen, said Trump. The media will come down on me for saying my blacks. They did that in California with that African-American fellow in the crowd, but you know what? I dont care. Stacey will respond to all the groups we need to reach.

One of those groups is the transgender community, Last June, the Clueless actress comments about bathroom use by transgender individuals created heated controversy. Dash said people who cant decide what they wanna be that day should go to the bathroom in the bushes.

Sources say Trumps camp may even be vetting Dash for vice president. So far, Trumps short list includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.

Shes very well-informed. Shes quite affected. Weve been looking into it, said Trump.

When asked if the term Negro was a proper term to use in 2016, a Trump spokesman said, The trouble with saying African-American is that not all blacks are from Africa, and some of them arent even Americans. Some of them are from Central America, and even Puerto Rico.

To be inclusive, we decided against colored, since the NAACP still uses that. We said no to black, because that sounded too polarizing. In the end, we went with negro. Its historically accurate. Nothing racist about it.

Not everything is about race, added the spokesman. We hope Stacey Dash will make that fact clear to you people once and for all.

"Hillary Clinton Lands in Texas Goes DIRECTLY to Muslim Fund-Raiser Collects $500000
","On a recent trip to Texas, Hillary Clinton showed she is directly in the pocket of Pakistani Muslims! 

Sources close to the private fundraiser held for Hillary Clinton in Beaumont, TX told 12News it raised hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Some estimates put the amount collected at half-a-million dollars, making it one of the top five private fundraisers Clinton has had in this country.

Pakistani businessman Tahir Javed hosted the reception for Clinton at this home in West Beaumont.

Former U.S. Representative Nick Lampson, who attended the event, says 250 people were there.

Lampson says Clinton spoke about education, healthcare and individual freedoms for people of all backgrounds and faiths.

Many of the Pakistanis at the event were pleased with Clinton's vocal support of the Muslim religion.

Aisha Zahid said, ""Talking about Muslims and favoring Muslims, so I really appreciate her whatever effort she is making against Islamaphobia, so I really think she needs to be the next President of the United States.""

Also in attendance, congress people from the Houston area, Sheila Jackson-Lee and Al Green.

But not everyone was a fan.  A handful of protesters demonstrated near the event, over Clinton's response to the Benghazi attack and her email controversy.

With all the terrorism perpetrated against the United States and our people - from 9/11 right up to the 14 people machine-gunned to death in San Bernardino, CA, -- why would Hillary do this?  Because Hillary Clinton is in the pocket of Muslims.

"BREAKING Another Clinton Associate Set To Testify Against Hillary Found Dead
","Americans have trouble trusting the Clintons for many reasons, but near the top of the list is the infamous Clinton kill list, featuring the names of people close to Hillary and Bill that have died under mysterious circumstances.

Now, it appears that yet another name has been added to this list.

Former U.N. President John Ashe was reportedly found dead last Wednesday. Officials claim he died of a heart attack, but others suspect foul play. The Conservative Tribune reports that local police officers in Dobbs Ferry, New York argue that Ashe died from a workout accident that crushed his throat.

Ashes death became even more suspicious when police learned that he was scheduled to be in court Monday with Chinese businessman and co-defendant Ng Lap Seng. Ashe reportedly received $1 billion in donations from Seng during his term as president.

It was later revealed that Seng also illegally funneled several hundred thousand dollars to the Democrat National Committee during Bills presidency. An anonymous source told reporters that prosecutors planned to use this link to Ashe to convince him to testify against her.

It would have been very embarrassing, the source added. His death was conveniently timed.

Of course, conspiracy theorists believe that Ashe is just the latest victim of the Clintons. We wouldnt put it past them to take down anyone who has damning information against themand God only knows how long that list is.

"""Clinton Cash Khizr Khan's Deep Legal Financial Connections to Saudi Arabia Hillary's Clinton Foundation Tie Terror
","Khizr Khan, the Muslim Gold Star father that the mainstream media and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been using to criticize Donald J. Trump, has deep ties to the government of Saudi Arabiaand to international Islamist investors through his own law firm. In addition to those ties to the wealthy Islamist nation, Khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the United Statesand has deep ties to the Clinton Cash narrative through the Clinton Foundation.
Khan and his wife Ghazala Khan both appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention to attack, on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons behalf, Donald Trumpthe Republican nominee for president. Their son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, was killed in Iraq in 2004. Khizr Khan, in his speech to the DNC, lambasted Donald Trump for wanting to temporarily halt Islamic migration to America from countries with a proven history of exporting terrorists.

Since then, Clinton operative George Stephanopouloswho served as a senior adviser to the president in Bill Clintons White House and is a Clinton Foundation donor as well as a host on the ABC networkpushed Trump on the matter in an interview. Trumps comments in that interview have sparked the same mini-rebellion inside his party, in the media and across the aisle that has happened many times before. The usual suspects inside the GOP, from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, have condemned Trump in one way or another. The media condemnation has been swift and Democrats, as well their friends throughout media, are driving the train as fast as they can.

But until now, it looked like the Khans were just Gold Star parents who the big bad Donald Trump attacked. It turns out, however, in addition to being Gold Star parents, the Khans are financially and legally tied deeply to the industry of Muslim migrationand to the government of Saudi Arabia and to the Clintons themselves.

Khan, according to Intelius as also reported by Walid Shoebat, used to work at the law firm Hogan Lovells, LLP, a major D.C. law firm that has been on retainer as the law firm representing the government of Saudi Arabia in the United States for years. Citing federal government disclosure forms, the Washington Free Beacon reported the connection between Saudi Arabia and Hogan Lovells a couple weeks ago.

Hogan Lovells LLP, another U.S. firm hired by the Saudis, is registered to work for the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia through 2016, disclosures show, Joe Schoffstall of the Free Beacon reported.

The federal form filed with the Department of Justice is a requirement under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, which makes lobbyists and lawyers working on behalf of foreign governments and other agents from abroad with interests in the United States register with the federal government.

The government of Saudi Arabia, of course, has donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given between $10 and $25 million to the foundation while Friends of Saudi Arabia has contributed between $1 and $5 million, Schoffstall wrote.

Trump, of course, has called on Hillary Clinton to have the Clinton Foundation return the money.

Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays, Trump wrote in a Facebook post back in June, according to Politico. Hillary must return all money from such countries!

Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate, Trump posted in a separate Facebook posting at the time. I am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation!

Of course, to this day, Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has kept the money from the Saudi Arabian government.

Schoffstalls piece in the Washington Free Beacon also notes how Hogan Lovells lobbyist Robert Kyle, per Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, has bundled more than $50,000 in donations for Clintons campaign this year.

Khans connections with the Hogan Lovells firm run deep, according to a report from Law.com written by Katelyn Polantz.

Many lawyers at Hogan Lovells remember the week in 2004 when U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan lost his life to a suicide bomber, Polantz wrote. Then-Hogan & Hartson attorneys mourned the death because the soldiers father, Khizr Khan, a Muslim American immigrant, was among their beloved colleagues.

Polantz wrote that Khan worked at the mega-D.C. law firm for years.

Khan spent seven years, from 2000 to 2007, in the Washington, D.C., office of then-Hogan & Hartson, Polantz wrote. He served as the firms manager of litigation technology. Although he did not practice law while at Hogan, Khan was well versed in understanding the American courts system. On Thursday night, he described his late son dreaming of becoming a military lawyer.

But representing the Clinton Foundation backing Saudi Arabian government and having one of its lobbyists bundle $50,000-plus for Clintons campaign are hardly the only places where the Khan-connected Hogan Lovells D.C. mega-firm brush elbows with Clinton Cash. 

The firm also handles Hillary Clintons taxes and is deeply connected with the email scandal whereby when she was Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton set up a home-brew email server system that jeopardized classified information handling and was extremely careless according to FBI director James Comey.

A lawyer at Hogan & Hartson [Howard Topaz] has been Bill and Hillary Clintons go-to guy for tax advice since 2004, according to documents released Friday by Hillary Clintons campaign, The American Lawyers Nate Raymond wrote in 2008, as Hillary Clinton ran for president that year. The Clintons tax returns for 2000-07 show combined earnings of $109 million, on which they paid $33 million in taxes. New York-based tax partner Howard Topaz has a broad tax practice, and also regularly advises corporations on M&A and executive compensation.

Breitbart News Patrick Howley, in a deep investigative piece on Hillary Clintons email scandal, late last year uncovered how Topazs firmwhich employed Khan while Topaz did Hillary Clintons taxesis also connected to the email scandal.

Topaz was a partner at Hogan & Hartson, which later merged to become known as Hogan Lovells, where Topaz continues to practice. The firms lawyers were major donors to Hillary Clintons first presidential campaign, Howley wrote.

For her private email system, Clinton used a spam filtering program MX Logic.

Hogan & Hartson handled the patent for MX Logics email-filtering program, which McAfee bought the small company for $140 million in 2009 in order to acquire, Howley wrote. The MX Logic companys application for a trademark for its SPAMTRAQ program was filed in 2004 on Hogan & Hartson stationery and signed by a Hogan & Hartson attorney. Hogan & Hartson has been responsible for MX Logic annual reports. The email companys Clinton links present more evidence that Clintons political and legal establishment was monitoring her private email use.

If that all isnt enough, that same Hogan & Hartson law firmnow Hogan Lovellsemployed Loretta Lynch, the current Attorney General of the United States. Lynch infamously just a few weeks ago met with Bill Clinton, Hillarys husband and the former president, on her private jet in Phoenix just before clearing Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing when it came to her illicit private email server system.

Khans own website for his own personal law firm KM Khan Law Office shows he represents clients in the business of buying visas to enter the United States. One of his specific areas of practice, according to the website, is E2 Treaty Investors, EB5 Investments & Related Immigration Services.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the U.S. Senates Judiciary Committee, has detailed how the EB5 immigration program is riddled with flaws and corruption.

Maybe it is only here on Capitol Hillon this island surrounded by realitythat we can choose to plug our ears and refuse to listen to commonly accepted facts, Grassley said in a statement earlier this year. The Government Accountability Office, the media, industry experts, members of congress, and federal agency officials, have concurred that the program is a serious problem with serious vulnerabilities. Allow me to mention a few of the flaws.

From there, Sen. Grassley listed out several of the flaws with the EB5 immigration program that Khan works in:

 Investments can be spent before business plans are approved. 

 Regional Center operators can charge exorbitant fees of foreign nationals in addition to their required investments.  

 Jobs created are not direct or verifiable jobs but rather are indirect and based on estimates and economic modeling.

 Jobs created by U.S. investors are counted by the foreign national when obtaining a green card, even if EB-5 money is only a fraction of the total invested.

 Investment funds are not adequately vetted. 

 Gifts and loans are acceptable sources of funds from foreign nationals.

 The investment level has been stagnant for nearly 25 years.

 Theres no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating regional centers or projects.

 Regional centers can be rented or sold without government oversight or approval.

 Regional centers dont have to certify that they comply with securities laws.  

 Theres no oversight of promoters who work overseas for the regional centers.

 Theres no set of sanctions for violations, no recourse for bad actors.

 There are no required background checks on anyone associated with a regional center.

 Regional centers draw Targeted Employment Area boundaries around poor areas in order to come in at a lower investment level, yet the jobs created are not actually created in those areas.

 Every Targeted Employment Area designation is rubberstamped by the agency.

 Adjudicators are pressured to get to a yes, especially for those politically connected. 

 Visas are not properly scrutinized. 

 Visas are pushed through despite security warnings.

 Files and applications lack basic and necessary information to monitor compliance.

 The agency does not do site visits for each and every project.

 Theres no transparency on how funds are spent, who is paid, and what investors are told about the projects they invest in.

Thats not to mention the fact that, according to Sen. Grassley, there have been serious national security violations in connection with the EB5 program that Khan works in and around already. In fact, the programaccording to Grassleywas used by Middle Eastern operatives from Iran to attempt to illicitly enter the United States.

There are also classified reports that detail the national security, fraud and abuse. Our committee has received numerous briefings and classified documents to show this side of the story, Grassley said in the early February 2016 statement. The enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security wrote an internal memo that raises significant concerns about the program. One section of the memo outlines concerns that it could be used by Iranian operatives to infiltrate the United States. The memo identifies seven main areas of program vulnerability, including the export of sensitive technology, economic espionage, use by foreign government agents and terrorists, investment fraud, illicit finance and money laundering.

Maybe all of this is whyas Breitbart News has previously notedthe Democratic National Convention made absolutely no mention of the Clinton Foundation or Clinton Global Initiative. Hillary Clintons coronation ceremony spent exactly zero minutes of the four nights of official DNC programming talking about anything to do with perhaps one of the biggest parts of her biography.

"Robertson Said He Had Vision of Trump Seated At the Right Hand of the Lord
","By Michael Hoult
Some Evangelical Christians are beginning to hold presumed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in high esteem. Several Evangelicals, including walking gaffe former Rep. Michelle Bachmann, already believe Trump, the thrice married, casino magnate, who appeared on the cover of Playboy, has been ordained by God.

But televangelist Pat Robertson has taken it one step further. He believes Trump is on par with Jesus Christ.

God came to me in a dream last night and showed me the future, said Robertson. He took me to heaven and I saw Donald Trump seated at the right hand of our Lord.

According to Raw Story, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, a 12,000-member megachurch, said Trump would make a better candidate than Jesus.

You know, I was debating an evangelical professor on NPR, and this professor said, Pastor, dont you want a candidate who embodies the teaching of Jesus and would govern this country according to the principles found in the Sermon on the Mount? said Jeffress. I said, Heck no. I would run from that candidate as far as possible, because the Sermon on the Mount was not given as a governing principle for this nation.

When Im looking for somebody whos going to deal with ISIS and exterminate ISIS, I dont care about that candidates tone or vocabulary, I want the meanest, toughest, son of a you-know-what I can find  and I believe thats biblical, said Jeffress.

Former presidential intern and the worlds second most famous presidential lay, Monica Lewinsky, has gone on record saying that she will be voting for her old flames wife, Hillary Clinton, in the next election.

Lewinsky, who is a staunch anti-bullying activist, says she couldnt possibly vote for Trump, because hes the biggest bully shes ever seen.

Ive spent years trying to stop bullying, in life and online, with children, teens, and adults, so what kind of message would it send if I voted for Donald Trump? asked Lewinsky. I understand that there are some weird ramifications of me voting for my former lovers wife, but you know, those were different times. That dress has long since been burned, if you know what I mean.

"Trump Suing Chicago After He's Forced To Cancel Rally
","After protests erupted in Chicago that led to the cancellation of a Donald Trump rally at the University of Illinois-Chicago Pavilion, the controversial Republican candidate has filed a lawsuit against the city for prohibiting his First Amendment right to free speech.    

My free speech right was infringed last Friday in Chicago and thats what it will say in the lawsuit, Trump told reporters. Well be asking for a monetary settlement and for those protestors to be prosecuted. It was very, very wrong of them. I do not condone violence. Im very against violence, especially at my campaign events.

Trumps attorneys drew extensive papers on the lawsuit and are filled on Monday. A Chicago judge will review them by next week.

Chicago violated my First Amendment right and they arent going to get away with it. Just like China wont get away with stealing our jobs and manipulating their currency.

The campaign thinks a conspiracy might be involved with the anti-trump protesters. When the cops saw a bunch of black people entering my rally, they knew they shouldnt be there but let them in anyway. I mean, what the Hell is that?

Trump then went after Chicagos Mayor Rahm Emanuel. I know Rahm thinks hes a tough guy, but hell be a mouse looking for his mom by the time I get done with him. He makes Little Rubio look like a giant.  A New Yorker will beat a Chicagoan every time. Believe me, he is going to regret not having his city under control.

He was terrible as Obamas Chief of Staff and hes been a terrible Mayor. Look at the gang problem and the cities credit rating.

Im happy Nabisco closed that Chicago factory and moved it to Mexico. I was against it before, but after tonight, Im totally for it.

The Mayor  

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel1 called the lawsuit frivolous and ridiculous.

You cant have a presidential candidate going around suing cities because the local people dont like the guy, Emanuel told the Chicago Tribune. The city is in massive debt and the last thing we need is to be tied up in court for years to come cause we know Trump loves to sue people. Legal fees arent cheap.

Trump claimed the Chicago Police Department told him to call off the event but they responded by saying it was Trumps campaign that called off the event and the Chicago Police did not infringe on his free speech right.

If Trump thinks he can bully the City of Chicago, hes got another thing coming.",F

"""Nancy Reagan's Last Words """"Do Not Vote For Donald Trump""""""
","LOS ANGELES, Calif.  Former first lady Nancy Reagan, who died on March 6 at the age of 94, remained mentally alert until the very end, according to a private nurse, who told reporters Mrs. Reagans last words to her were, Do not vote for Donald Trump.

She watched all the [GOP] debates, said the nurse, identified as Althea Thoone. She was very alert and kept up with all the news and current events, especially about the election. She said no true Republican would cast a vote for Donald Trump.

She was not happy at all because I dont believe she thought Donald Trump was a real Republican. She took a turn for the worse after the [11th] debate when he started talking about his private parts, and all that other nonsense about Mitt Romney getting down on his knees.

During the debate held on March 4, Trump responded to Romneys public attack against him by saying, He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees. He would have dropped to his knees.

Trump also alluded to the size of his penis during the debate, responding to a joke about the size of his hands told by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

The so-called 11th Commandment, Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican, once espoused by Ronald Reagan, now seems to be a relic from the past, when a kinder, gentler political sensibility existed in Washington, at least between members of the same party.

He broke that commandment, and a few others too, as far as Im concerned, said Thoone, who became somewhat of a confidant to Mrs. Reagan in her last years. She remembered that crack he made about her not being very beautiful too.

I wouldnt say Donald Trump caused her to pass, because thats up to the Lord, but he certainly didnt help any. She couldnt believe what she was seeing and hearing up there. She would just look over to me and shake her head.

Thoone reports that Mrs. Reagan hoped to attend at least one of the GOP debates, but the strain of travel and her advanced age prevented such a trip. She was happy to see George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara at the Feb. 25 debate, says Thoone.

Mrs. Reagans last public appearance was on July 6, 2015, at her 94th birthday celebration.",F
"RUPAUL CLAIMS TRUMP TOUCHED HIM INAPPROPRIATELY IN THE 1990S
","The famous drag queen, actor and recording artist Rupaul, claims that Donald Trump grabbed his ass and genitals during a party in 1995.

In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Rupaul said that Mr Trump made a move on him during an event celebrating the release of the movie To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.

The artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman.

I had just come out of the bathroom when Trump jumped on me and kissed me, he explained. He started grabbing my ass and pulled my dress up to grab my genitals. He suddenly became very angry. He started yelling and cursing, and he left the party.


Rupaul says he was dressed very sexy for the party and is convinced that Trump thought he was a woman.
Rupaul says he found Donald Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity.

Rupaul told the Hollywood Inquirer that Donald Trump moved on him during a party, grabbing his ass and genitals.
He just wanted to use me as an object, he told Hollywood Inquirer. Ive never felt so dirty in my life! In a way, I was saved by the fact that Im a man.

This allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump.

Many women have come forward over the last week to denounce the abusive groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years.

The New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumpss alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered.

All these allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News.

The comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show Access Hollywood.

The remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation.

You know Im automatically attracted to beautiful  I just start kissing them. Its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait, Trump said. And when youre a star they let you do it. You can do anything.

He added: Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.

In Rupauls case, Trump seems to have been disappointed by what he discovered under the dress.",F

Told that Evangelicals want to trust his stance on traditional marriage, Trump responded:

I think they can trust me on traditional marriage and frankly, I was very much in favor of having the court rule that it goes to states, and let the states decide. And that was a shocking decision for you and for me and for a lot of other people, but I was very much in favor of letting the states decide and thats the way it looked it was going and then all of a sudden out of nowhere came this very massive decision and they took it away.

"Donald Trump Bombshell Ted Cruz's Wife Former Call Girl
","Indianapolis, IN  Some are calling Donald Trumps recent revelation a low blow and dirty politics. Some are calling it fair play in a very dirty game. This morning via Twitter as promised, Donald Trump spilled the beans about his opponent, Lyin Ted Cruz wife, Heidi. In a Skype interview with Donald Trump this morning, The Scooper was able to get some clarification in this new aspect of the Trump, Cruz feud.

Lyin Ted Cruz is married to a former call girl. Its terrible. So terrible, stated the Donald. I mean, Lyin Ted Cruz thinks that Americans want a call girl in the White House? Its terrible. Just terrible, rambled Mr. Trump.

When asked how he came to be in possession of this information, Mr. Trump responded, Its terrible. I didnt want to have to spill the beans. But I warned him (Cruz) not to go down this path. I warned him. Its terrible. He put out an attack ad about my wife. Its terrible, terrible. I warned him. But, he wants to play dirty. I know about a lot of skeletons in GOP closets. Its terrible. That is why the GOP is so very, very afraid of me. They know that I know, and they know that I will say what I know if I have to say what I know. You know? Its terrible. Just horrible.

When asked why he thought this was terrible, the Scooper asked a follow-up question.

How do you know, and is your assertion that Heidi Cruz is a former call girl the truth?

Well, I have been in the same room with her when she has committed these terrible, terrible acts. I have pictures! I have video! exclaimed The Donald. She is sitting there, dialing the phone. One poor person after another having to endure unsolicited calls from this girl. She wouldnt stop. She called, and called, and called. Its terrible. Horrible.

"WikiLeaks CONFIRMS Hillary Sold Weapons to ISIS Then Drops Another BOMBSHELL!
","Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is a controversial character. But theres no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and hes willing to expose Hillary Clinton.

Now, hes announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria.

Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate.

WikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested:

The Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua.
Sounds familiar?

In Obamas second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.

Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called Friends of Syria (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.

Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack.

In an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
Via The Duran

Here is the incredible transcript:

JUAN GONZLEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clintons private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and whats the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base?
JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesnt exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And its gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some caseor contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We cant possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand.

So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, thats there in those emails. Theres more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clintons collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.",F

Putin: Hacked Emails Reveal That Clinton Threatened Sanders Wife
Posted on July 29, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in News, US // 0 Comments
The Kremlin claim the Clinton campaign 
   
Kremlin sources say the Clinton campaign sent their goons to give Jane Sanders the shakedown, in order to end the Bernie Sanders campaign before the convention, citing evidence from one of 10,000 Hillary emails Putin has in his personal possession. 

The Clinton campaign needed Bernie Sanders on board before the emails were leaked as they contained evidence that confirmed his suggestions of Democratic establishment bias and would have given him unstoppable momentum heading into the convention  had he chosen to play that game.

The Kremlin have threatened to release 20,000 emails that Russia have hacked from Hilary Clinton's email server.
Kremlin To Release 20,000 Hacked Hillary Clinton Emails

However after the meeting with the Clinton team Sanders unexpectedly suspended his previously gung-ho campaign, and although he refused to wholeheartedly endorse her, he signalled to his supporters that his run for President was effectively over.

Kremlin sources have denied the DNC claims that Russian state-sponsored hackers are behind the email leaks, with Julian Assange also stating the DNC claim is a politically motivated lame conspiracy smear.

Despite the FBI asking the Kremlin for copies of any emails they have in their possession, it is understood the Kremlin has not released anything to anyone, including Wikileaks.

According to Kremlin sources, the source of the Wikileaks email trove could have come from a huge number of possible sources, as intelligence communities around the whole world have copies of Hillarys emails. Everybody is talking about them.

Senior staff in the Kremlin have been allowed to see the emails, however Putin alone has access to them and keeps them on his personal laptop, under lock and key. He has been heard staying up until 2am, reading their contents out loud, roaring with laughter.

President Vladimir Putin is said to be amused by Democratic Party attempts to portray him as the villain, when their own failings are on display for all to see. They always need a babayka [boogeyman] to frighten people with. I am the Eastern boogeyman, it seems.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reached out to the Kremlin, promising them rewards if they release Hillary Clintons missing emails.

Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing, Trump said on Wednesday.

I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Lets see if that happens. That will be next.

President Vladimir Putins spokesman, while not directly denying Russian involvement in the hack, said Moscow would never interfere in another countrys election.

President Putin more than once has said that Russia would never interfere and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, especially in the electoral process, Dmitry Peskov told journalists Wednesday in a conference call.

Peskov also criticized the willingness to accuse Russia of wrongdoing. If we talk about some sort of suspicions against a country, then it is necessary at a minimum to be precise and concrete, the spokesman said.

He said speculation in this case does not show a constructive attitude.",F

She also repeated on #DebateNight the established Democrat talking point that the contents of the documents posted by WikiLeaks arent nearly as important as the fact that Russia is hacking our servers  a threat so severe that she decided to set up her own private email server in her house.

"""Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out """"I Was Paid $3500 To Protest Trumps Rally""""""
","PHOENIX A.Z. (AP)  For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from Trumps rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.

I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trumps rally in Fountain Hills, said 37-year-old Paul Horner. I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.

Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders campaign, but Horner disagrees.

As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clintons campaign, Horner said. The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called Women Are The Future. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is. Horner continued, It was mostly women in their 60s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.

Craigslist ad for Donald Trump protesters
A screenshot of the Craigslist ad that Horner says he responded to. The actual ad has since been removed. (Dennis System, File) / ABC News
I knew those werent real protesters, they were too organized and smart, said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em and stuff. Downey continued, I think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommys house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.

When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.

Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I dont think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.

Ill protest that guy for free, Bradley said. Trump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldnt have to pay me anything to protest that. Bradley continued, Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.

Horner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trumps rally.

During training we were taught chants to shout like Dump Trump and Trump Is A Racist, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, Were just going to tunnel underneath it. They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said F*ck Donald Trump along with a sign to hold that said Make America White Again.

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the Silverback gorilla my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a child, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us. Mikkelson continues, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?

"Pope Francis Endorses Bernie Sanders for President!!
","atican City  In a final speech to the synod, Pope Francis endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, while taking some clear swipes at conservatives who hold up church doctrine above all else, and use it to cast judgment on others.

The synod experience also made us better realize that the true defenders are not those who uphold its letter, but its spirit; not ideas but people; not formulas but free availability of Gods love and forgiveness, Pope Francis said. I see in Senator Bernard Sanders a man of great integrity and moral conviction, who understands these principles and genuinely wants whats best for all people

The pope went on to criticize ultra-conservatives, saying church leaders should confront difficult issues fearlessly, without burying our heads in the sand. It was the latest in a series of admonitions to bishops by the pontiff, who has stressed since his election in 2013 that the 1.2 billion-member Church should be open to change, side with the poor, and rid itself of the arrogance and unfettered narcissism that has alienated so many Catholics in recent years.

Naturally, conservative Catholics are not happy with Francis for being so outspoken on social issues and American politics. The pope needs to stick to religion, and stay the hell out of politics, says Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali. Conservative Catholics are losing faith in the Church, and this falls directly on the shoulders of Pope Francis with his socialist ideology and warped political views.

Conservative news outlets like Fox News have taken issue with Pope Francis on everything from climate change to income inequality. Bill OReilly has numerous times compared Pope Francis to Bernie Sanders, accusing both of being false prophets.

Liberals and progressives on the other hand applaud the pope for bringing social and environmental issues to the forefront of the Catholic Church. Hes a Catholic rockstar, says Prudence Bradley, 19, from upstate New York. Pope Francis has made it cool to be a Christian again.",F
"Stanford University Confirms Democratic Election Fraud
","A bombshell study released by Stanford University confirms evidence of election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Party primaries. 

According to a paper released this week entitled, Are we witnessing a dishonest election?, a state comparison based on the voting procedures used during the election reveals endemic election fraud within the system.

Given the stakes in the outcome of the American presidential elections, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process is of the utmost importance.

Are the results we are witnessing in the 2016 primary elections trustworthy? While Donald Trump enjoyed a clear and early edge over his Republican rivals, the Democratic contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernard Sanders has been far more competitive.

At present, Secretary Clinton enjoys an apparent advantage over Sanders. Is this claimed advantage legitimate?

We contend that it is not, and suggest an explanation for the advantage: States that are at risk for election fraud in 2016 systematically and overwhelmingly favor Secretary Clinton. We provide converging evidence for this claim.

First, we show that it is possible to detect irregularities in the 2016 Democratic Primaries by comparing the states that have hard paper evidence of all the placed votes to states that do not have this hard paper evidence. Second, we compare the final results in 2016 to the discrepant exit polls.

Furthermore, we show that no such irregularities occurred in the 2008 competitive election cycle involving Secretary Clinton against President Obama.

As such, we find that in states wherein voting fraud has the highest potential to occur, systematic efforts may have taken place to provide Secretary Clinton with an exaggerated margin of support.",F
"BREAKING Fraudulent Clinton Votes Discovered By The “Tens Of Thousands
","Election officials in Franklin County, Ohio are reportedly stumped over what one maintenance worker found in a dilapidated downtown Columbus warehouse earlier this week.

According to sources, Randall Prince, a Columbus-area electrical worker, was doing a routine check of his companies wiring and electrical systems when he stumbled across approximately one dozen black, sealed ballot boxes filled with thousands of Franklin County votes for Hillary Clinton and other Democrat candidates.

No one really goes in this building.  Its mainly used for short-term storage by a commercial plumber, Prince said.

So when Prince, who is a Trump supporter, saw several black boxes in an otherwise empty room, he went to investigate.  What he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state.

Early voting does not begin in Ohio until October 12, so no votes have officially been castin the Buckeye state.  However, inside these boxes were, what one source described as, potentially tens of thousands of votes for Hillary Clinton.

","Earlier tonight, Ted Cruz announced he was getting out of the race for the Republican Nomination. Cruz was defeated by Donald Trump through a particularly large margin. To this point, Ted Cruz had served as Donald Trumps strictest competitor in the often contentious race.

Approximately one hour after leaving the campaign site, Ted Cruz was spotted in a nearby store purchasing trash bags, bleach, and a shovel  fueling rampant speculation that he was none other than the Zodiac Killer getting back to his old ways.

"Trump Using Brown Paper Bag Test at Rally's No Dark Skin Blacks Allowed
","WOW..

Donald Trump has sent the Internet into a frenzy again today by adding a new stipulation for people that come to see him speak at his campaign rallys and its called the Brown Paper Bag Test

For those unfamiliar with the brown paper test, its where the skin tone of African-Americans were visually measured against an actual brown paper bag; individuals lighter than the bag were labeled with more positive attributes compared to dark skin males and females.

""The Brown Paper Bag Test""
The Brown Paper Bag Test
It gained popularity after the abolishment of slavery in 1865 and unconsciously, this test still seems to exists within the black community, especially when it comes to dating. Preference is natural in any aspect of life but within the black community bias stereotypes can fog decisions and lead to unhealthy relationships.

Now Donald Trump has decided to use this test at all future campaign rallys and if you are not lighter than the brown paper bag you will not gain entry into any of his Pep Rallys.

"Sarah Palin To Become The Vice President Running Mate For The 2nd Time
","In a recent interview, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin commented that she isnt ruling out the possibility of becoming a vice presidential candidate for Donald Trump. Still, she expressed concerns that her position on the campaign trail could do more harm than good.

When asked about the issue on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday, Palin called herself a realist and acknowledged that a run for office would bring a ton of controversy.

Well, I want to help and not hurt, and I am such a realist that I realize there are a whole lot of people out there who would say anybody but Palin, the former GOP vice presidential nominee commented.

So, you know, I just  I just want the guy to win, she added. I want American to win. And I dont know if I would be the person that would be able to help him win, Jake.

Palin did point out, however, that Palin has already had her background investigated ruthlessly.

I think Im pretty much as vetted as anybody in the country, Palin commented. So, I think there are so many other great people out there in America who can serve in this position. I think if someone wanted to choose me, they already know who I am, what I stand for. They wouldnt be in for any surprises.

Palin would be a controversial pick, there is no doubt, but Trump could do a lot worse. She served John McCain well in his 2008 campaign for president.

"IRELAND IS NOW OFFICIALLY ACCEPTING TRUMP REFUGEES FROM AMERICA
","Inishturk, an island off the main coast of Ireland, has now joined Canada in officially accepting Americans requesting political asylum from a Donald Trump presidency.

The island has been experiencing a population decline in recent years, and they decided to try to reach out to Americans seeking to flee our current political dystopia by offering a new place to live if the idea of Donald Trump and the Republicans following his lead are just too much.

Mary Heanue, Inishturks development officer, was quoted as saying:

Ive heard there are quite a few people in America looking to move to Ireland and other countries if Donald Trump becomes president. Id like them to know that wed love to see them consider moving over here.

Our big concern is employment and trying to encourage families to move over here because the population is declining. The island featured on an Irish TV documentary last year which gave us great publicity and a good few extra bookings. But we ended up having a terrible summer and a lot of people canceled.

Theyd be given a huge welcome and theyd find this is a fantastic place to live and to bring up children. Their kids would probably get the best education anywhere in the country too, because the teacher to pupil ratio is nearly one-on-one.

Although winters can be hard and its the kind of life that wouldnt necessarily suit everyone, theyd find it very peaceful here and theyd soon find out theres nowhere as nice in the world on a summers day than here.

The website IrishCentral.com also got in on the action recently, by publishing their own guide on moving to Ireland in case Donald Trump is elected.

The website describes the details, and realities, of moving to Ireland. It isnt particularly cheap and the financial restrictions on it might preclude some people from being able to take advantage of it.

However, there are some big things on the plus side. The gun laws are restrictive and you wont see wannabe cowboys carrying handguns openly in Ireland  a huge plus. They have strong social welfare and services, plus did I mention universal heathcare? Not exactly a terrible idea  They also do take some well-placed digs at our Republican problem, by making a few short jabs at the likes of Bill OReilly and Donald Trump in particular, by stressing that you request an absentee ballot so you can still vote against Donald Trump for a nice middle finger from across the pond.

More than likely, Trump will not get elected. However, it never hurts to have a backup plan, especially if you dont fit into one of the new state-approved ethnic groups (whites only) that will be one of the features of a possible Donald in the White House.",F
"Sanders Campaign Prepares For Independent Run In The General Election
","A quiet burst of activity from the Sanders campaign seems to all but guarantee that Sanders will run as an independent this election cycle. All across the country Sanders core infrastructure of volunteers and paid staff are mobilizing to collect signatures and perform necessary paperwork to get him on the general election ballots in the states.

Officials highly placed within the Sanders campaign remain evasive and deny that the senator plans, at this time, to run as an independent. Sanders campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, has stated time and time again that they intend to go all the way to the convention and make the case that Sanders should be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 general election. But the Sanders campaign is actively engaging in activities, within the states, that have no other purpose besides putting Sanders in the position of being able to run as an independent candidate against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

If Sanders were to run in the general election, as the evidence of his campaigns actions point to, it could disastrously impact Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clintons ability to win against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. With present polling showing Clinton ahead of Trump in the general election by only six points, even a small split of democratic/democratic leaning independent voters would virtually guarantee a Trump victory and presidency. And with divisiveness and disunity within the Democratic party over policy direction and candidate choice at an all time high, polling experts say Sanders could syphon off as much as 20% of the democratic vote in a 3 candidate general election.

Many of Sanders supporters have been openly and vocally calling for the senator to run as an independent if he fails to secure the Democratic nomination. Citing unfair favouritism toward Clinton by the DNC under Debbie Wasserman Schultz, highly suspicious deviations between primary exit polling and election results, Sanders supporters have made the argument that the systematic corruption within the Democratic party will not allow progressive ideas and platforms to flourish if the party elite believe they can act with impunity and still count on the vote of progressives. It has been reported that Sanders is privately supportive of this type of analysis, and his coming independent candidacy will be engineered to force the party to the left, going forward, if they wish to compete against Republicans on a national level.

Sources within the Sanders campaign, speaking on conditions of anonymity, say that Sanders has indeed been seriously considering an independent run, and wishes to ensure the option is available to him by performing the necessary work now. If Sanders were to wait until after the convention to lay the legal foundation for an independent run it would be too late. It is this fact that explains the Sanders campaigns actions toward inclusion on state ballots as an independent at this time.",F
"Donald Trump Meets With WWE Owner Vince McMahon About Serving As Running Mate
","Donald Trump is looking to assemble a strong team of experienced business leaders as he enters into the intense general election phase. While many expected Trump to consider government leaders, he is leaning on long time WWE boss Vincent K. McMahon to serve as his running mate.

Trump and McMahon met for more than two hours earlier today at Trumps New York headquarters.

This is not the first time Mr. McMahon has been involved in politics. His wife Linda has run for political office on multiple occasions. His experience and notoriety would offer a boost to Donalds campaign as it enters the toughest battle he has faced thus far.

Look, Vince McMahon is someone I deeply admire. We had a discussion today and I think hes the guy. Listen, this is our countrys future. Vince gave us Stone Cold. Vince gave us The Rock. Vince gave us DX. How can you argue with his record? We need this guy. He gave us the Texas Rattlesnake for god sakes. Trump told reporters after a media event.

For his part, Vince McMahon said he and Trump had a lot in common.

We both say youre fired, were both businessmen, we both love wrestling. You know who else loves wrestling? America. You know who hates wrestling? Hilary. McMahon said, appearing ready for his possible role as VP.

It remains to be seen if or when Trump would confirm the WWE boss as his potential running mate. Experts say it wont be long if theyve already met.

The way the story was told to us was that Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us. And thats all we knew.I remember asking Who is Donald Trump? I truly didnt know anything about him, Stickney said.

In their new book, Bill & Hillary: So This is That Thing Called Love, the authors interview Clinton insiders who claim that Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President favored unprotected sex.

And while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery. Over the years, both Clintons have kept their medical records a secret. Clinton has explained his rapidly changing appearance to his heart surgery and new diet but he has looked increasingly thin and weak at Hillary campaign rallies.

"Graham Says Christians Must Support Trump or Face Death Camps

Franklin Graham, son of famed preacher Billy Graham, has urged Christians to vote for thrice married, casino owner Donald Trump. According to Graham, who feels Trump has been chosen by God, the reality TV star was the only thing standing between Christians and death camps.

The liberal Democrats are openly hostile to Christians, said Graham in an interview on WEHW radio. We wont survive four more years of Democrat-led government.

"PENTAGON OFFICIALS FURIOUS AFTER CLINTON ANNOUNCES US RESPONSE TIME FOR NUCLEAR LAUNCH DURING DEBATE
","Following Wednesdays presidential debate Pentagon officials found themselves completely dumbfounded as to why former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would feel it appropriate to announce U.S. Special Access Program intel on national television.

According to sources within the Department of Defense speaking under anonymity, Clinton likely violated at least two Dept. of Defense SAP protocols during the debate by announcing on live television the United States Governments response time for a nuclear launch.To the dismay of intelligence officials, the fact that this top secret information is now publicly known not only proves that Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief, but it also poses a direct threat to national security.

One high ranking intelligence official explained that any time frame calculated pertaining to a US nuclear launch would have merely been an educated hypothesis, absent leaked documents and there have been no such breaches prior to Clintons admission Wednesday.

Via TruePundit

Secretary Clinton proved tonight she is unfit to be commander-in-chief, a top-ranking DOD intelligence source said. What she did compromises our national security. She is cavalier and reckless and in my opinion should be detained and questioned so we can unravel why she did what she did.

According to Pentagon sources, the information Clinton disseminated publicly is Top Secret intelligence governed under the U.S. Special Access Program (SAP) which dictates safeguards and protocols for accessing and discussing highly classified and Top Secret intelligence. The specific details of the countrys nuclear response time discussed by Clinton, sources said, are only known by a handful of individuals outside top military brass

Targeting options by ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missiles), air or sea, launch order, launch procedures and response are some of the most secretly guarded tenets of national security and nuclear war policy, a Pentagon source said. Its truly incredible that (nuclear) response time as part of an ERO (Emergency Response Option) is now out there in the public domain to our adversaries.

U.S. Defense sources said according to developed U.S. counterintelligence, military officials in China, North Korea, Syria, Russia, Iran and even actors like ISIS had no previous definitive intelligence to determine the U.S. nuclear response time, especially during an ERO, prior to Clintons admission Wednesday night.

"FBI director received millions from Clinton Foundationmhis brother's law firm does Clinton's taxes
","A review of FBI Director James Comeys professional history and relationships shows that the Obama cabinet leader  now under fire for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton  is deeply entrenched in the big-money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C. His personal and professional relationships  all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton  reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe.

These concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comeys former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partners board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundations taxes.

Lockheed Martin

When President Obama nominated Comey to become FBI director in 2013, Comey promised the United States Senate that he would recuse himself on all cases involving former employers.

But Comey earned $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year.

Comey served as deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush administration. When he left the Bush administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became vice president, acting as a general counsel.

How much money did James Comey make from Lockheed Martin in his last year with the company, which he left in 2010? More than $6 million in compensation.

Lockheed Martin is a Clinton Foundation donor. The company admitted to becoming a Clinton Global Initiative member in 2010.

According to records, Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton $250,000 to deliver a speech in 2010.

In 2010, Lockheed Martin won 17 approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department.

HSBC Holdings

In 2013, Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings.

Mr. Comeys appointment will be for an initial three-year term which, subject to re-election by shareholders, will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 Annual General Meeting, according to HSBC company records.

HSBC Holdings and its various philanthropic branches routinely partner with the Clinton Foundation. For instance, HSBC Holdings has partnered with Deutsche Bank through the Clinton Foundation to retrofit 1,500 to 2,500 housing units, primarily in the low- to moderate-income sector in New York City.

Retrofitting refers to a Green initiative to conserve energy in commercial housing units. Clinton Foundation records show that the Foundation projected $1 billion in financing for this Green initiative to conserve peoples energy in low-income housing units.

Who Is Peter Comey?

When our source called the Chinatown offices of D.C. law firm DLA Piper and asked for Peter Comey, a receptionist immediately put him through to Comeys direct line. But Peter Comey is not featured on the DLA Piper website.

Peter Comey serves as Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas for DLA Piper. James Comey was not questioned about his relationship with Peter Comey in his confirmation hearing.

DLA Piper is the firm that performed the independent audit of the Clinton Foundation in November during Clinton-Worlds first big push to put the email scandal behind them. DLA Pipers employees taken as a whole represent a major Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign donation bloc and Clinton Foundation donation base.

DLA Piper ranks #5 on Hillary Clintons all-time career Top Contributors list, just ahead of Goldman Sachs.

And here is another thing: Peter Comey has a mortgage on his house that is owned by his brother James Comey, the FBI director.

Peter Comeys financial records, obtained by Breitbart News, show that he bought a $950,000 house in Vienna, Virginia, in June 2008. He needed a $712,500 mortgage from First Savings Mortgage Corporation.

But on January 31, 2011, James Comey and his wife stepped in to become Private Party lenders. They granted a mortgage on the house for $711,000. Financial records suggest that Peter Comey took out two such mortgages from his brother that day.

This financial relationship between the Comey brothers began prior to James Comeys nomination to become director of the FBI.

DLA Piper did not answer any question as to whether James Comey and Peter Comey spoke at any point about this mortgage or anything else during the Clinton email investigation.",F

The republican candidate for president freely admits to being a little rusty on Canadian history, but feels confident that the United States owned Canada at some point, and claims giving it back was a major mistake.

The former reality tv star was responding to a question about Puerto Rico possibly becoming the 51st of the United States, when he made the statement.

I personally think it was the biggest mistake in American history, giving Canada back. Look at that place now, its falling to pieces. Its overrun by godless, gunless hippies and its such a shame to see.

As the host nodded along, Trump explained that America got a terrible deal with Canada who stole the land over a thousand years ago or something like that.

It was a truly awful deal. Canada gets Toronto and Vancouver, which has the hottest women, and what did we get? Alaska? The Florida of Canada? Such a terrible deal.

","A week after Sarah Palin endorsed Donald Trump for president, the former Alaskan Governor is now endorsing Iowa Caucus winner, Ted Cruz.

Palin told the Alaskan Times, After deep meditation while hunting me some moose, I decided Ted Cruz is the real man for the job. Its hard for me to admit, since Ive only been wrong once or twice in my life, but I have to do the right thing and put my support behind Ted.

---- Scroll down to read more ----
While he might be using tactics, Im a dirty gal and know what it takes to win. Im prouder than a duck dating a mongoose to support Ted Cruz.

Well see who wins New Hampshire, though, since there are a lot of primaries and caucuses left, and I want to pick the winner, so my endorsement will go how the political winds go. I could end up endorsing myself by the time this process is done.

Trump called Palin an Indian Giver after she changed her endorsement and gave it to rival Ted Cruz.

Is her endorsement even worth anything? Trump asked supporters at a New Hampshire rally. First she doomed McCain; then she doomed me in Iowa. I think Ill stay as far away from that nut job as possible and let Ted deal with the Palin curse. Let me tell you the truth, I didnt know what the hell she was talking about most of the time. I dont understand her appeal.",F
"""Hillary Clinton In 2013 """"I Would Like To See People Like Donald Trump Run For Office; They're Honest And Can't Be Bought""""""
","Before running against billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump for the presidency, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told an audience at a private, paid speech she wanted to see more successful businessmen and women run for office because they cant be bought.

In a speech made public by Wikileaks  which released an email from Hillary for America Research Director Tony Caark containing three attached speeches given at a private Goldman Sachs events  Clinton spoke and took audience questions at the Builders and Innovators Summit hosted by Goldman Sachs on October 29, 2013.

Answering a question about businessmen in politics, Clinton said that they are most often the people that look over the horizon, and therefore share a vision that many politicians of today lack. And thats a very good question and thank you for asking it. Yes, I would love to see more businessmen go into politics because I believe they would bring in an entirely different mindset and strategies than what were used to seeing traditionally, she opined.

And then she just had to go on. In fact, when you say businessmen and women, I cant help but think of a particular one that I would just love to see running for the presidency at some point in the future, Clinton added. I dont know what it is exactly about him, I cant quite put my finger on it, but my instinct is almost never wrong. And its telling me that Donald Trump would be very successful if he were to venture into politics in the future.

Asked to elaborate on her statement, the former Secretary of State argued that she thinks that businessmen cant be bought and that theyre very honest. And I think that goes especially for Donald Trump, whose successful projects and business ventures have made him synonymous with big business and, more importantly, creating thousands of jobs. I also think he understands the philanthropic and charitable side of things quite well, which is a crucial skill for any politician, she praised her current counter-candidate.

I think he has a lot to offer to this country and its people, especially when were talking about the economy, she continued. Donald Trump has single-handedly helped stop the recession, more so than dozens of other so-called billionaires. And I dont know how the experts on the matter feel, but in my book thats hard evidence of the mans business prowess and integrity, as well. And I think everyone would agree those are commendable character traits for anyone looking to tackle the most difficult problems and challenges in the world, quite literally.

So, yes  Donald Trump is someone I could very easily see winning the support of the people. And I dont think he would do that with his flammable rhetoric and negotiation skills  which are both things hes known for  but with common sense and respect for his fellow countrymen. But, most of all  I think his relationship with the opposite sex would bring him the most political points. I think he respects women and treats them as equals and I also think that would bring him a significant lead over anyone unlucky enough to be running against him, she ominously concluded in her 2013 speech.",F
"TED CRUZ WILL SPEAK AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION
","PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (The Adobo Chronicles, Washington Bureau)  Sources close to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) have confirmed to The Adobo Chronicles that the chosen theme for this years convention is Vote Your Conscience.

The theme reinforces the idea that it is unconscionable for any American to vote for Donald Trump.

And what better person to expound on this theme than former Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz.

Cruz emphasized this theme during his speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland earlier this week. He has been invited by DNC to speak just before Hillary Clinton delivers her nomination acceptance speech.  He has accepted.

Upon learning of the news, Trump accused Cruz of being a turncoat and a sore loser.  The senator from Texas refused to endorse Trump during his Cleveland speech, eliciting boos from the Republican crowd.

We caught up with Cruz on his way to Philadelphia and asked him if this meant he was voting for Clinton in November.  I am still undecided, but I know that my wife Heidi Cruz will. In no way is she voting for a misogynist like Trump.

During the Republican primaries, Trump and Cruz became engaged in a personal war of words, with Trump sharing an unflattering picture of Heidi on Twitter.",F
"FBI Completes Review of Newly Revealed Hillary Clinton Emails Finds No Evidence of Criminality
","FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the bureau won't change the conclusion it made in July after it examined newly revealed emails related to the Hillary Clinton probe.

""Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,"" Comey wrote in a letter to 16 members of Congress.

The investigative team had ""been working around the clock to process and review"" emails found on former New York congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop  using a program that targeted only the emails to and from Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, within the time when Clinton was secretary of state.

In a statement, a Justice Department spokesman said, ""The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously.""

The news comes after the FBI announced it would review a new batch of emails that appeared to be ""pertinent"" to the investigation that was suspended in July, which had looked into Clinton's use of a private server.

Multiple federal sources told NBC News that the emails were found as a part of an ongoing probe into Weiner's alleged illicit communication with an underage girl.

On the Clinton campaign's plane, spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said she was ""glad to see"" that Comey had affirmed the conclusion reached in July and that the ""matter is resolved.""

The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.

On Twitter, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump surrogate, started the campaign's pivot back to the ""rigged system"" claims they shared earlier in the election season.

A senior law enforcement official confirmed to NBC News that nearly all of the thousands of newly examined emails on Weiner's laptop were duplicates of emails already seen by the team investigating Clinton's server. Although some emails did forward documents previously identified as containing classified information, the review didn't change the total number of classified documents investigators found on the server.


There were unseen emails, the official said, but they were unrelated to government business.

"A Republican intellectual explains why the Republican Party is going to die
","CLEVELAND  Avik Roy is a Republicans Republican. A health care wonk and editor at Forbes, he has worked for three Republican presidential hopefuls  Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio. Much of his adult life has been dedicated to advancing the Republican Party and conservative ideals.

But when I caught up with Roy at a bar just outside the Republican convention, he said something Ive never heard from an establishment conservative before: The Grand Old Party is going to die.

I dont think the Republican Party and the conservative movement are capable of reforming themselves in an incremental and gradual way, he said. Theres going to be a disruption.

Roy isnt happy about this: He believes it means the Democrats will dominate national American politics for some time. But he also believes the Republican Party has lost its right to govern, because it is driven by white nationalism rather than a true commitment to equality for all Americans.

Until the conservative movement can stand up and live by that principle, it will not have the moral authority to lead the country, he told me.

This is a standard assessment among liberals, but it is frankly shocking to hear from a prominent conservative thinker. Our conversation had the air of a confessional: of Roy admitting that he and his intellectual comrades had gone wrong, had failed, had sinned.

His history of conservatism was a Greek tragedy. It begins with a fatal error in 1964, survived on the willful self-delusion of people like Roy himself, and ended with Donald Trump.

I think the conservative movement is fundamentally broken, Roy tells me. Trump is not a random act. This election is not a random act.

The conservative movements founding error: Barry Goldwater

In 1955, William F. Buckley created the intellectual architecture of modern conservatism by founding National Review, focusing on a free market, social conservatism, and a muscular foreign policy. Buckleys ideals found purchase in the Republican Party in 1964, with the nomination of Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater lost the 1964 general election, his ideas eventually won out in the GOP, culminating in the Reagan Revolution of 1980.

Normally, Goldwaters defeat is spun as a story of triumph: how the conservative movement eventually righted the ship of an unprincipled GOP. But according to Roy, its the first act of a tragedy.

Goldwaters nomination in 1964 was a historical disaster for the conservative movement, Roy tells me, because for the ensuing decades, it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rights.

THE GRAVITATIONAL CENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS WHITE NATIONALISM
Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He himself was not especially racist  he believed it was wrong, on free market grounds, for the federal government to force private businesses to desegregate. But this principled stance identified the GOP with the pro-segregation camp in everyones eyes, while the Democrats under Lyndon Johnson became the champions of anti-racism.

This had a double effect, Roy says. First, it forced black voters out of the GOP. Second, it invited in white racists who had previously been Democrats. Even though many Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act in Congress, the post-Goldwater party became the party of aggrieved whites.

The fact is, today, the Republican coalition has inherited the people who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  the Southern Democrats who are now Republicans, Roy says. Conservatives and Republicans have not come to terms with that problem.

Conservative intellectuals were blind to the truth about the GOP  hence Trump

The available evidence compiled by historians and political scientists suggests that 1964 really was a pivotal political moment, in exactly the way Roy describes.

Yet Republican intellectuals have long denied this, fabricating a revisionist history in which Republicans were and always have been the party of civil rights. In 2012, National Review ran a lengthy cover story arguing that the standard history recounted by Roy was popular but indefensible.

This revisionism, according to Roy, points to a much bigger conservative delusion: They cannot admit that their partys voters are motivated far more by white identity politics than by conservative ideals.

Conservative intellectuals, and conservative politicians, have been in kind of a bubble, Roy says. Weve had this view that the voters were with us on conservatism  philosophical, economic conservatism. In reality, the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism.

Conservative intellectuals, for the most part, are horrified by racism. When they talk about believing in individual rights and equality, they really mean it. Because the Republican Party is the vehicle through which their ideas can be implemented, they need to believe that the party isnt racist.

So they deny the partys racist history, that its post-1964 success was a direct result of attracting whites disillusioned by the Democrats embrace of civil rights. And they deny that to this day, Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty.

Its the power of wishful thinking. None of us want to accept that opposition to civil rights is the legacy that weve inherited, Roy says.

He expands on this idea: Its a common observation on the left, but its an observation that a lot of us on the right genuinely believed wasnt true  which is that conservatism has become, and has been for some time, much more about white identity politics than it has been about conservative political philosophy. I think today, even now, a lot of conservatives have not come to terms with that problem.

This, Roy believes, is where the conservative intellectual class went astray. By refusing to admit the truth about their own party, they were powerless to stop the forces that led to Donald Trumps rise. They told themselves, over and over again, that Goldwaters victory was a triumph.

But in reality, it created the conditions under which Trump could thrive. Trumps politics of aggrieved white nationalism  labeling black people criminals, Latinos rapists, and Muslims terrorists  succeeded because the partys voting base was made up of the people who once opposed civil rights.

[Trump] tapped into something that was latent in the Republican Party and conservative movement  but a lot of people in the conservative movement didnt notice, Roy concludes, glumly.

For conservatism to live, the conservative movement has to die
 
A sign with one of the RNCs most popular slogans. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Cal)
Over beers, I ask Roy how he feels about all of this personally. His answer is very sad.

When Marco [Rubio] lost, I went through the five stages of grief. It was tough. I had to spend some time thinking about what to do for the next several years of my life, he says.

I left a comforting and rewarding career as a biotech investor to do this kind of work. I did it because I felt it was important, and I care about the country. Maybe its cheesy to say that, but I really sincerely do, he continues. So then, okay, what do I do? Do I do the same things Ive been doing for the last four years? To me, just to do that to collect a paycheck didnt make a lot of sense.

This soul-searching led Roy to an uncomfortable conclusion: The Republican Party, and the conservative movement that propped it up, is doomed.

Both are too wedded to the politics of white nationalism to change how they act, but that just isnt a winning formula in a nation thats increasingly black and brown. Either the Republican Party will eat itself or a new party will rise and overtake its voting share.

Either the disruption will come from the Republican Party representing cranky old white people and a new right-of-center party emerging in its place, or a third party will emerge,  la the Republicans emerging from the Whigs in the [1850s], Roy says.

The work of conservative intellectuals today, he argues, is to devise a new conservatism  a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America.

I think its incredibly important to take stock, he says, and build a new conservative movement that is genuinely about individual liberty.

I dont know how this would work. I dont think Roy knows either.

For the entire history of modern conservatism, its ideals have been wedded to and marred by white supremacism. Thats Roys own diagnosis, and I think its correct. As a result, we have literally no experience in America of a politically viable conservative movement unmoored from white supremacy.

Ive read dozens of conservative intellectuals writing compellingly about non-racist conservative ideals. Writers like Andrew Sullivan, Ross Douthat, Reihan Salam, Michael Brendan Dougherty, and too many others to count have put forward visions of a conservative party quite different from the one we have.

But not one of these writers, smart as they are, has been able to explain what actual political constituency could bring about this pure conservatism in practice. The fact is that limited government conservatism is not especially appealing to nonwhite Americans, whereas liberalism and social democracy are. The only ones for whom conservatism is a natural fit are Roys cranky old white people  and theyre dying off.

Maybe Roy and company will be able to solve this problem. I hope they do. America needs a viable, intellectually serious right-of-center party.

Because we now know what the alternative looks like. Its Donald Trump.

"The smug style in American liberalism
","There is a smug style in American liberalism. It has been growing these past decades. It is a way of conducting politics, predicated on the belief that American life is not divided by moral difference or policy divergence  not really  but by the failure of half the country to know what's good for them.

In 2016, the smug style has found expression in media and in policy, in the attitudes of liberals both visible and private, providing a foundational set of assumptions above which a great number of liberals comport their understanding of the world.

It has led an American ideology hitherto responsible for a great share of the good accomplished over the past century of our political life to a posture of reaction and disrespect: a condescending, defensive sneer toward any person or movement outside of its consensus, dressed up as a monopoly on reason.

The smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography.

Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, the working class, once the core of the coalition, began abandoning the Democratic Party. In 1948, in the immediate wake of Franklin Roosevelt, 66 percent of manual laborers voted for Democrats, along with 60 percent of farmers. In 1964, it was 55 percent of working-class voters. By 1980, it was 35 percent.

The white working class in particular saw even sharper declines. Despite historic advantages with both poor and middle-class white voters, by 2012 Democrats possessed only a 2-point advantage among poor white voters. Among white voters making between $30,000 and $75,000 per year, the GOP has taken a 17-point lead.

Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt
The consequence was a shift in liberalism's intellectual center of gravity. A movement once fleshed out in union halls and little magazines shifted into universities and major press, from the center of the country to its cities and elite enclaves. Minority voters remained, but bereft of the material and social capital required to dominate elite decision-making, they were largely excluded from an agenda driven by the new Democratic core: the educated, the coastal, and the professional.

It is not that these forces captured the party so much as it fell to them. When the laborer left, they remained.

The origins of this shift are overdetermined. Richard Nixon bears a large part of the blame, but so does Bill Clinton. The Southern Strategy, yes, but the destruction of labor unions, too. I have my own sympathies, but I do not propose to adjudicate that question here.

Suffice it to say, by the 1990s the better part of the working class wanted nothing to do with the word liberal. What remained of the American progressive elite was left to puzzle: What happened to our coalition?

Why did they abandon us?

What's the matter with Kansas?

The smug style arose to answer these questions. It provided an answer so simple and so emotionally satisfying that its success was perhaps inevitable: the theory that conservatism, and particularly the kind embraced by those out there in the country, was not a political ideology at all.

How politics makes us stupid

The trouble is that stupid hicks don't know what's good for them. They're getting conned by right-wingers and tent revivalists until they believe all the lies that've made them so wrong. They don't know any better. That's why they're voting against their own self-interest.

As anybody who has gone through a particularly nasty breakup knows, disdain cultivated in the aftermath of a divide quickly exceeds the original grievance. You lose somebody. You blame them. Soon, the blame is reason enough to keep them at a distance, the excuse to drive them even further away.

Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt. The result is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Financial incentive compounded this tendency  there is money, after all, in reassuring the bitter. Over 20 years, an industry arose to cater to the smug style. It began in humor, and culminated for a time in The Daily Show, a program that more than any other thing advanced the idea that liberal orthodoxy was a kind of educated savvy and that its opponents were, before anything else, stupid. The smug liberal found relief in ridiculing them.

The internet only made it worse. Today, a liberal who finds himself troubled by the currents of contemporary political life need look no further than his Facebook newsfeed to find the explanation:

Study finds Daily Show viewers more informed than viewers of Fox News.


They're beating CNN watchers too.

NPR listeners are best informed of all. He likes that.

You're better off watching nothing than watching Fox. He likes that even more.

The good news doesn't stop.

Liberals aren't just better informed. They're smarter.

They've got better grammar. They know more words.

Smart kids grow up to be liberals, while conservatives reason like drunks.

Liberals are better able to process new information; they're less biased like that. They've got different brains. Better ones. Why? Evolution. They've got better brains, top-notch amygdalae, science finds.

The smug style created a feedback loop. If the trouble with conservatives was ignorance, then the liberal impulse was to correct it. When such corrections failed, disdain followed after it.

Of course, there is a smug style in every political movement: elitism among every ideology believing itself in possession of the solutions to society's ills. But few movements have let the smug tendency so corrupt them, or make so tenuous its case against its enemies.

""Conservatives are always at a bit of a disadvantage in the theater of mass democracy,"" the conservative editorialist Kevin Williamson wrote in National Review last October, ""because people en masse aren't very bright or sophisticated, and they're vulnerable to cheap, hysterical emotional appeals.""

The smug style thinks Williamson is wrong, of course, but not in principle. It's only that he's confused about who the hordes of stupid, hysterical people are voting for. The smug style reads Williamson and says, ""No! You!""

Elites, real elites, might recognize one another by their superior knowledge. The smug recognize one another by their mutual knowing.

Knowing, for example, that the Founding Fathers were all secular deists. Knowing that you're actually, like, 30 times more likely to shoot yourself than an intruder. Knowing that those fools out in Kansas are voting against their own self-interest and that the trouble is Kansas doesn't know any better. Knowing all the jokes that signal this knowledge.

The studies, about Daily Show viewers and better-sized amygdalae, are knowing. It is the smug style's first premise: a politics defined by a command of the Correct Facts and signaled by an allegiance to the Correct Culture. A politics that is just the politics of smart people in command of Good Facts. A politics that insists it has no ideology at all, only facts. No moral convictions, only charts, the kind that keep them from ""imposing their morals"" like the bad guys do.

Knowing is the shibboleth into the smug style's culture, a cultural that celebrates hip commitments and valorizes hip taste, that loves nothing more than hate-reading anyone who doesn't get them. A culture that has come to replace politics itself.

The knowing know that police reform, that abortion rights, that labor unions are important, but go no further: What is important, after all, is to signal that you know these things. What is important is to launch links and mockery at those who don't. The Good Facts are enough: Anybody who fails to capitulate to them is part of the Problem, is terminally uncool. No persuasion, only retweets. Eye roll, crying emoji, forward to John Oliver for sick burns.

The smug style has always existed in American liberalism, but it wasn't always so totalizing. Lionel Trilling claimed, as far back as 1950, that liberalism ""is not only the dominant, but even the sole intellectual tradition,"" that ""the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse ... do not express themselves in ideas, but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.""

The smug style has always existed in American liberalism, but it wasn't always so totalizing
Richard Hofstadter, the historian whose most famous work, The Paranoid Style in American Politics, this essay exists in some obvious reference to, advanced a similar line in writing not so well-remembered today. His then-influential history writing drips with disdain for rubes who regard themselves as victimized by economics and history, who have failed to maintain correct political attitudes.

But 60 years ago, American liberalism relied too much on the support of working people to let these ideas take too much hold. Even its elitists, its Schlesingers and Bells, were tempered by the power of the labor movement, by the role Marxism still played in even liberal politics  forces too powerful to allow non-elite concerns to entirely escape the liberal mental horizon. Walter Reuther, and Bayard Rustin, and A. Philip Randolph were still in the room, and they mattered.


Sixty years ago, the ugliest tendencies were still private, too. The smug style belonged to real elites, knowing in their cocktail parties, far from the ears of rubes. But today we have television, and the internet, and a liberalism worked out in universities and think tanks. Today, the better part of liberalism is Trillings  or those who'd like to be, at any rate  and everyone can hear them.

On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court found that denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples constituted a violation of the 14th Amendment. After decades of protests, legislation, setbacks, and litigation, the 13 states still holding out against the inevitable were ordered to relent. Kim Davis, a clerk tasked with issuing marriage licenses to couples in her Kentucky county, refused.

At the distance of six months, it is surprising that she was, beyond a few short-lived and empty efforts, the only civil bureaucrat to do so. One imagines a hundred or a thousand Kim Davises in the country, small administrators with small power, outraged by the collapse of a moral fight that they were winning just a few years prior.

In the days between the June decision and the July 1 announcement that the American Civil Liberties Union would represent four couples who had been denied marriage licenses by the Rowan County Clerk's office, many braced for resistance. Surely compliance would come hard in some places. Surely, some of the losers would refuse to give up. There was something giddy about it  at long last, the good guys would be the ones bearing down with the full force of the law.

It did not take long for the law to correct Davis. On August 12, a judge ordered a stay, preventing Davis from refusing any further under the protection of the law. The Sixth Circuit, and then the Supreme Court, refused to hear her appeal.

Despite further protest and Davis's ultimate jailing for contempt of court, normal service was restored in short order. The 23,000 people of Rowan Country suffered, all told, slightly less than seven weeks without a functioning civil licensure apparatus.

Davis remained a fixation. Dour, rural, thrice divorced but born again  Twitter could not have invented a better parody of the uncool. She was ridiculed for her politics but also for her looks  that she had been married so many times was inexplicable! That she thought she had the slightest grasp of the Constitution, doubly so.

When Davis was jailed for five days following her refusal to comply with the court order, many who pride themselves on having a vastly more compassionate moral foundation than Davis cheered the imprisonment of a political foe.

The ridicule of Davis became so pronounced that even smug circles, always on the precipice of self-reproach, began eventually to rein in the excess. Mocking her appearance, openly celebrating the incarceration of an ideological opponent  these were not good looks.

But a more fundamental element of smug disdain for Kim Davis went unchallenged: the contention, at bottom, that Davis was not merely wrong in her convictions, but that her convictions were, in themselves, an error and a fraud.

That is: Kim Davis was not only on the wrong side of the law. She was not even a subscriber to a religious ideology that had found itself at moral odds with American culture. Rather, she was a subscriber to nothing, a hateful bigot who did not even understand her own religion.

Christianity, as many hastened to point out, is about love. Christ commands us to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. If the Bible took any position on the issue at all, it was that divorce, beloved by Davis, was a sin, and that she was a hypocrite masquerading among the faithful.

How many of these critiques were issued by atheists?

This, more than anything I can recall in recent American life, is an example of the smug style. Many liberals do not believe that evangelical Christianity ought to guide public life; many believe, moreover, that the moral conceits of that Christianity are wrong, even harmful to society. But to the smug liberal, it isn't that Kim Davis is wrong. How can she be? She's only mistaken. She just doesn't know the Good Facts, even about her own religion. She's angry and confused, another hick who's not with it.

It was an odd thing to assert in the case of Christianity, a religion that until recently was taken to be another shibboleth of the uncool, not a loving faith misunderstood by bigots. But this is knowing: knowing that the new line on Jesus is that the homophobes just don't get their own faith.

Kim Davis was behind the times. Her beliefs did not represent a legitimate challenge to liberal consensus because they did not represent a challenge at all: They were incoherent, at odds with the Good Facts. Google makes every man a theologian.

This, I think, is fundamental to understanding the smug style. If good politics and good beliefs are just Good Facts and good tweets  that is, if there is no ideology beyond sensible conclusions drawn from a rational assessment of the world  then there are no moral fights, only lying liars and the stupid rubes who believe them.

When Davis was first released from county jail, Mike Huckabee went to meet her. But the smug style sees no true ideology there, no moral threat to contend with. Only a huckster and a hick: one to be ridiculed, and the other to be refuted. What more, the smug man posts, could there be to say about it? They're idiots! Look, look: This Onion article nails it.

Popular story:

Adlai Stevenson, Democratic candidate for president, is on parade. A band is playing. Onlookers cheer. He waves to the crowd.

A woman shouts: ""Gov. Stevenson, you have the vote of every thinking person in this country!""

Stevenson replies: ""Thank you, ma'am, but we need a majority.""


The smug style says to itself, Yeah. I really am one of the few thinking people in this country, aren't I?

In November of last year, during the week when it became temporarily fashionable for American governors to declare that Syrian refugees would not be welcome in their state, Hamilton Nolan wrote an essay for Gawker called ""Dumb Hicks Are America's Greatest Threat.""

If there has ever been a tirade so dedicated to the smug style, to the proposition that it is neither malice, nor capital, nor ideological difference, but rather the backward stupidity of poor people that has ruined the state of American policy, then it is hidden beyond our view, in some uncool place, far from the front page of Gawker.

They are underestimating, though, the much greater danger: dumbass hicks, in charge of things,"" Nolan wrote. ""...You, our elected officials, are embarrassing us. All of us, except your fellow dumb hicks, who voted for you in large numbers. You  our racist, xenophobic, knuckle-dragging ignorant leaders  are making us look bad in front of the guests (the whole world). You are the bad cousin in the family who always ruins Thanksgiving. Go in the back room and drink a can of beer alone please.""

Among the dumb hicks Nolan identifies are ""many Southern mayors"" and ""many lesser known state representatives."" He cites the Ku Klux Klan  ""exclusively dumbass hicks,"" he writes. ""100%,"" he emphasizes  despite the fact that the New York Times, in an investigation of white supremacist members of Stormfront.org, found that ""the top reported interest of Stormfront members is reading."" That they are ""news and political junkies."" Despite the fact that if ""you come compare Stormfront users to people who go to the Yahoo News site, it turns out that the Stormfront crowd is twice as likely to visit nytimes.com.""

""They have long threads praising Breaking Bad and discussing the comparative merits of online dating sites, like Plenty of Fish and OKCupid,"" the Times reports.

In another piece, published later the same month, Nolan wrote that ""Inequality of wealth  or, if you like, the distribution of wealth in our society in a way that results in poverty  is not just one issue among many. It is the root from which blooms nearly all major social problems.""

He's right about that. But who does he imagine is responsible for this inequality? The poor? The dumb? The hicks?

Hamilton Nolan isn't stupid. He has even, lately, argued that even the worst of the rubes must be allies in class struggle. Yet the trouble is still swallowing what ""motherfuckers"" those people are.

Nolan is perhaps the funniest and most articulate of those pointing fingers at the ""dumbass hicks,"" but he isn't alone. It is evidently intolerable to a huge swath of liberalism to confess the obvious: that those responsible have homes in Brooklyn, too. That they buy the same smartphones. That they too are on Twitter. That the oligarchs are making fun of stupid poor people too. That they're better at it, and always will be.

No: The trouble must be out there, somewhere. In the country. Where the idiots are; where the hicks are too stupid to know where problems blossom.

""To the dumb hick leaders of America, I say: (nothing). You wouldn't listen anyhow,"" Nolan writes. ""My words would go in one ear and right out the other. Like talking to an old block of wood.""

It's a shame. They might be receptive to his concerns about poverty.

If there is a single person who exemplifies the dumbass hick in the smug imagination, it is former President George W. Bush. He's got the accent. He can't talk right. He seems stupefied by simple concepts, and his politics are all gee-whiz Texas ignorance. He is the ur-hick. He is the enemy.

He got all the way to White House, and he's still being taken for a ride by the scheming rightwing oligarchs around him  just like those poor rubes in Kansas. If only George knew Dick Cheney wasn't acting in his own best interests!

It is worth considering that Bush is the son of a president, a patrician born in Connecticut and educated at Andover and Harvard and Yale.

It is worth considering that he does not come from a family known for producing poor minds.


It is worth considering that beginning with his 1994 gubernatorial debate against Ann Richards, and at every juncture thereafter, opponents have been defeated after days of media outlets openly speculating whether George was up to the mental challenge of a one-on-one debate.

""Throughout his short political career,"" ABC's Katy Textor wrote on the eve of the 2000 debates against Al Gore, ""Bush has benefited from low expectations of his debating abilities. The fact that he skipped no less than three GOP primary debates, and the fact that he was reluctant to agree to the Commission on Presidential Debates proposal, has done little to contradict the impression of a candidate uncomfortable with this unavoidable fact of campaign life.""

""Done little to contradict.""

On November 6, 2000, during his final pre-election stump speech, Bush explained his history of political triumph thusly: ""They misunderesimated me.""

What an idiot. American liberals made fun of him for that one for years.

It is worth considering that he didn't misspeak.


He did, however, deliberately cultivate the confusion. He understood the smug style. He wagered that many liberals, eager to see their opponents as intellectually deficient, would buy into the act and thereby miss the more pernicious fact of his moral deficits.

He wagered correctly. Smug liberals said George was too stupid to get elected, too stupid to get reelected, too stupid to pass laws or appoint judges or weather a political fight. Liberals misunderestimated George W. Bush all eight years of his presidency.

George W. Bush is not a dumbass hick. In eight years, all the sick Daily Show burns in the world did not appreciably undermine his agenda.

The smug mind defends itself against these charges. Oh, we're just having fun, it says. We don't mean it. This is just for a laugh, it's just a joke, stop being so humorless.

It is exasperating, after all, to have to live in a country where so many people are so aggressively wrong about so much, they say. You go on about ideology and shibboleths and knowing, but we are right on the issues, aren't we? We are right on social policy and right on foreign policy and right on evolution, and same-sex marriage, and climate change too. Surely that's what matters.

We don't really mean they're all stupid  but hey, lay off. We're not smug! This is just how we vent our frustration. Otherwise it would be too depressing having to share a country with these people!

We have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief and not, for instance, the animating public strategy of an entire wing of the liberal culture apparatus. The Daily Show, as it happens, is not the private entertainment of elites blowing off some steam. It is broadcast on national television.

Twitter isn't private. Not that anybody with the sickest burn to accompany the smartest chart would want it to be. Otherwise, how would everyone know how in-the-know you are?

The rubes have seen your videos. You posted it on their wall.

Still don't get why liberal opinion is correct? This video settles the debate for good.

I have been wondering for a long time how it is that so many entries to the op-ed pages take it as their justifying premise that they are arguing for a truth that has never been advanced before.

We have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief
""It's an accepted, nearly unchallenged assumption that Muslim communities across the U.S. have a problem  that their youth tend toward violent ideology, or are susceptible to ""radicalization"" by groups like the Islamic State,"" began an editorial that appeared last December in the New York Times. But ""after all,"" it goes on, ""the majority of mass shootings in America are perpetrated by white men but no one questions what might have radicalized them in their communities.""

But this contention  that Muslims possess superlative violent tendencies  has been challenged countless times, hasn't it? It was challenged here, and here and here as far back as 9/11. The president of the United State challenged it on national television the night before this editorial was published. The Times itself did too. The myopic provincialism of anybody who believes that Muslims are a uniquely violent people is the basis of a five-year-old Onion headline, not some new moral challenge.

The smug style leaves its adherents no other option: If an idea has failed to take hold, if the Good Facts are not widely accepted, then the problem must be that these facts have not yet reached the disbelievers.


In December 2015, Public Policy Polling found that 30 percent of Republicans were in favor of bombing Agrabah, the Arab-sounding fictional city from Disney's Aladdin. Hilarious.

PPP has run joke questions before, of course: polling the popularity of Deez Nuts, or asking after God's job approval. But these questions, at least, let their audience in on the gag. Now liberalism is deliberately setting up the last segment of the population actually willing to endure a phone survey in service of what it knew would make for some hilarious copy when the rubes inevitably fell for it. This is not a survey in service of a joke  it is a survey in service of a human punchline.

As if only Republicans covered up gaps in their knowledge by responding to what they assume is a good-faith question by guessing from their general principles.

It may be easy to mistake with the private venting of frustrated elites, but the rubes can read the New York Times, too. It is not where liberals whisper to each other about the secret things that go unchallenged. Poll respondents are not the secret fodder for a joke.

""Late-breaking sexism"": why younger women arent excited about electing a woman president

This is the consequence of ""private"" venting, and it is the consequence of knowing too: If good politics comes solely from good data and good sense, it cannot be that large sections of the American public are merely wrong about so many vital things. It cannot be that they have heard our arguments but rejected them  that might mean we must examine our own methods of persuasion.

No: it is only that the wrong beliefs are unchallenged  that their believers are trapped in ""information bubbles"" and confirmation bias. That no one knows the truth, except the New York Times (or Vox). If only we could tell them, question them, show them this graph. If they don't get it then, well, then they're hopeless.

The smug style plays out in private too, of course. If you haven't started one yourself, you've surely seen the Facebook threads: Ten or 20 of Brooklyn's finest gather to say how exasperated they are, these days, by the stupidity of the American public.

""I just don't know what to do about these people,"" one posts. ""I think we have to accept that a lot of people are just misinformed!"" replies another. ""Like, I think they actually don't want to know anything that would undermine their worldview.""

They tend to do it in the comment section, under an article about how conservatives are difficult to persuade because they isolate themselves in mutually reinforcing information bubbles.

What have been the consequences of the smug style?

It has become a tradition for the smug, in editorials and essay and confident Facebook boasting, to assume that the presidential debates will feature their candidate, in command of the facts, wiping the floor with the empty huckster ignorance of their Republican opponent.

It was popularly assumed, for a time, that George W. Bush was too stupid to be elected president.

The smug believed the same of Ronald Reagan.


John Yoo, the architect of the Bush administration's torture policies, escaped The Daily Show unscathed. Liberals wondered what to do when Jon Stewart fails. What would success look like? Were police waiting in the wings, a one-way ticket to the Hague if Stewart nailed him?

It would be unfair to say that the smug style has never learned from these mistakes. But the lesson has been, We underestimated how many people could be fooled.

That is: We underestimated just how dumb these dumb hicks really are.

We just didn't get our message to them. They just stayed in their information bubble. We can't let the lying liars keep lying to these people  but how do we reach these idiots who only trust Fox?


Rarely: Maybe they're savvier than we thought. Maybe they're angry for a reason.

As it happens, reasons aren't too difficult to come by.

During a San Francisco fundraiser in the 2008 primary campaign, Barack Obama offered an observation that was hailed not without some glee as the first unforced error from then-Senator Cool.

""You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania,"" Obama said, ""and, like, a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate, and they have not. And it's not surprising then they get bitter. They cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.""

It's the latter part that we remember eight years later  the clinging to guns and religion and hate  but it is the first part that was important: the part about lost jobs and neglect by two presidential administrations.

Obama's observation was not novel.

The notion that material loss and abandonment have driven America's white working class into a fit of resentment is boilerplate for even the Democratic Party's tepid left these days. But in the president's formulation and in the formulation of smug stylists who have embraced some material account of uncool attitudes, the downturn, the jobs lost and the opportunities narrowed, are a force of nature  something that has ""been happening"" in the passive voice.

If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it's, Why are they voting against their own self-interest?
This, I suspect, will one day become the Republican Party's rationale for addressing climate change: Look, we don't know how the dead hooker wound up in the hotel room. But she's here now, that's undeniable, so we've gotta get rid of the body.

Today, it is the excuse of American smug mind: Where did all of these poor people come from?

If pressed for an answer, I suppose they would say Republicans, elected by rubes voting against their own self-interest. Reagan, Gingrich, Bush  all those Bad Factknowing halfwits who were too dumb to get elected to anything.

Well, sure. In the past 30 years of American life, the Republican Party has dedicated itself to replacing every labor law with a photo of Ronald Reagan's face.

But this does not excuse liberals beating full retreat to the colleges and the cities, abandoning the dispossessed to their fate. It does not excuse surrendering a century of labor politics in the name of electability. It does not excuse gazing out decades later to find that those left behind are not up on the latest thought and deciding, We didn't abandon them. The idiots didn't want to be saved.

It was not Ronald Reagan who declared the era of big government. It was not the GOP that decided the coastally based, culturally liberal industries of technology, Hollywood, and high finance were the future of the American economy.


If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it's, Why are they voting against their own self-interest? But no party these past decades has effectively represented the interests of these dispossessed. Only one has made a point of openly disdaining them too.

Abandoned and without any party willing to champion their interests, people cling to candidates who, at the very least, are willing to represent their moral convictions. The smug style resents them for it, and they resent the smug in turn.


The rubes noticed that liberal Democrats, distressed by the notion that Indiana would allow bakeries to practice open discrimination against LGBTQ couples, threatened boycotts against the state, mobilizing the considerable economic power that comes with an alliance of New York and Hollywood and Silicon Valley to punish retrograde Gov. Mike Pence, but had no such passion when the same governor of the same state joined 21 others in refusing the Medicaid expansion. No doubt good liberals objected to that move too. But I've yet to see a boycott threat about it.

Early in the marriage equality fight, activists advanced the theory that when people discovered a friend or relative was gay, they became far more likely to support gay rights. They were correct. These days it is difficult for anybody in a position of liberal power  whether in business, or government, or media  to avoid having openly gay colleagues, colleagues whom they like and whom they'd like to help.

But few opinion makers fraternize with the impoverished. Few editors and legislators and Silicon Valley heroes have dinner with the lovely couple on food stamps down the road, much less those scraping by in Indiana.

If any single event provided the direct impetus for this essay, it was a running argument I had with an older, liberal writer over the seriousness of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Since June 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy, this writer has taken it upon himself each day to tell his Facebook followers that Donald Trump is a bad kind of dude.

That saying as much was the key to stopping him and his odious followers too.

""Ridicule is the most powerful weapon we have against any of our enemies,"" he told me in the end, ""but especially against the ones who, not incorrectly, take it so personally and lash out in ways that shine klieg lights on those very flaws we detest.

""If you're laughing at someone, you're certainly not respecting him.""

""Anyway,"" he went on, ""I'm done talking to you. We see the world differently. I'm fine with that. We don't need to be friends.""

Ridicule is the most effective political tactic.


Ridicule is especially effective when it's personal and about expressing open disdain for stupid, bad people.


Political legitimacy is granted by the respect of elite liberals.


You can't be legitimate if you're the butt of our jokes.


If you don't agree, we can't work together politically.


We can't even be friends, because politics is social.


Because politics is performative  if we don't mock together, we aren't on the same side.


If there is a bingo card for the smug style somewhere, then cross off every square. You've won.

I would be less troubled if I did not believe that the smug style has captured an enormous section of American liberalism. If I believed that its politics, as practiced by its supporters, extended beyond this line of thought. If this were an exception.

But even as many have come around to the notion that Trump is the prohibitive favorite for his party's nomination, the smug interpretation has been predictable: We only underestimated how hateful, how stupid, the Republican base can be.

Trump capturing the nomination will not dispel the smug style; if anything, it will redouble it. Faced with the prospect of an election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the smug will reach a fever pitch: six straight months of a sure thing, an opportunity to mock and scoff and ask, How could anybody vote for this guy? until a morning in November when they ask, What the fuck happened?

On March 20, Salon's David Masciotra wrote that if Trump ""actually had the strength to articulate uncomfortable and inconvenient truths, he would turn his favorite word  'loser'  ??not on full-time professionals in the press, but on his supporters.""

Masciotra goes on:

Journalists found that in the counties where Trump is most dominant, there are large numbers of white high school dropouts, and unemployed people no longer looking for work. An alliance with the incoherent personality cult of Donald Trump's candidacy correlates strongly with failure to obtain a high school diploma, and withdrawal from the labor force. The counties also have a consistent history of voting for segregationists, and have an above average percentage of its residents living in mobile homes.

The kicker: ""Many conservatives, and even some kindhearted liberals, might object to the conclusions one can draw from the data as stereotyping, but the empirical evidence leaves little choice. Donald Trump's supporters confirm the stereotype against them.""

Here's the conclusion I draw: If Donald Trump has a chance in November, it is because the knowing will dictate our strategy. Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse, they will comfort with own impotence by shouting, ""Idiots!"" again and again, angrier and angrier, the handmaidens of their own destruction.

The smug style resists empathy for the unknowing. It denies the possibility of a politics whereby those who do not share knowing culture, who do not like the right things or know the Good Facts or recognize the intellectual bankruptcy of their own ideas can be worked with, in spite of these differences, toward a common goal.

It is this attitude that has driven the dispossessed into the arms of a candidate who shares their fury. It is this attitude that may deliver him the White House, a ""serious"" threat, a threat to be mocked and called out and hated, but not to be taken seriously. 

The wages of smug is Trump.

Nothing is more confounding to the smug style than the fact that the average Republican is better educated and has a higher IQ than the average Democrat. That for every overpowered study finding superior liberal open-mindedness and intellect and knowledge, there is one to suggest that Republicans have the better of these qualities.

Most damning, perhaps, to the fancy liberal self-conception: Republicans score higher in susceptibility to persuasion. They are willing to change their minds more often.

The Republican coalition tends toward the center: educated enough, smart enough, informed enough.

The Democratic coalition in the 21st century is bifurcated: It has the postgraduates, but it has the disenfranchised urban poor as well, a group better defined by race and immigration status than by class. There are more Americans without high school diplomas than in possession of doctoral degrees. The math proceeds from there.

The smug style takes this as a defense. Elite liberalism, and the Democratic Party by extension, cannot hate poor people, they say. We aren't smug! Just look at our coalition. These aren't rubes. Just look at our embrace of their issues.

But observe how quickly professed concern for the oppressed becomes another shibboleth for the smug, another kind of knowing. Mere awareness of these issues becomes the most important thing, the capacity to articulate them a new subset of Correct Facts.

Everyone in the know has read ""The Case for Reparations,"" but it was the reading and performed admiration that counted, praised in the same breath as, ""It is a better history than an actual case for actually paying, of course...""

Pretend for a moment that all of it is true. That the smug style apprehended the world as it really is, that knowing  or knowing, no inflection  did make our political divide. That the problem is the rubes. That the dumbass hicks are to blame. They can't help it: Their brains don't work. They isolate themselves from all the Good Facts, and they're being taken for a ride by con men.

Pretend the ridicule worked too: that the videos and the Twitter burns and destroying the opposition made all the bad guys go away.

What kind of world would it leave us? An endless cycle of jokes? Of sick burns and smart tweets and knowing? Relative to whom? The smug style demands an object of disdain; it would find a new one quickly.

It is central to the liberal self-conception that what separates them from reactionaries is a desire to help people, a desire to create a fairer and more just world. Liberals still want, or believe they still want, to make a more perfect union.

Whether you believe they are deluded or not, whether you believe this project is worthwhile in any form or not, what I am trying to tell you is that the smug style has fundamentally undermined even the aspiration, that it has made American liberalism into the worst version of itself.

It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them. It becomes all at once too easy to decide you know best, to never hear, much less ignore, protest to the contrary.

At present, many of those most in need of the sort of help liberals believe they can provide despise liberalism, and are despised in turn. Is it surprising that with each decade, the ""help"" on offer drifts even further from the help these people need?

It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them
Even if the two could be separated, would it be worth it? What kind of political movement is predicated on openly disdaining the very people it is advocating for?

The smug style, at bottom, is a failure of empathy. Further: It is a failure to believe that empathy has any value at all. It is the notion that anybody worthy of liberal time and attention and respect must capitulate, immediately, to the Good Facts.

If they don't (and they won't) you're free to write them off and mock them. When they suffer, it's their just desserts.

Make no mistake: I am not suggesting that liberals adopt a fuzzy, gentler version of their politics. I am not suggesting they compromise their issues for the sake of playing nice. What I am suggesting is that the battles waged by liberalism have drifted far away from their old egalitarian intentions.

I am suggesting that open disdain for the people they say they want to help has led them to stop helping those people, too.

I am suggesting that in the case of a Kim Davis, liberalism resist the impulse to go beyond the necessary legal fight and explicitly delight in punishing an old foe.

I am suggesting that they instead wonder what it might be like to have little left but one's values; to wake up one day to find your whole moral order destroyed; to look around and see the representatives of a new order call you a stupid, hypocritical hick without bothering, even, to wonder how your corner of your poor state found itself so alienated from them in the first place. To work with people who do not share their values or their tastes, who do not live where they live or like what they like or know their Good Facts or their jokes.

This is not a call for civility. Manners are not enough. The smug style did not arise by accident, and it cannot be abolished with a little self-reproach. So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class, they will search for reasons to justify that failure. They will resent them. They will find, over and over, how easy it is to justify abandoning them further.  They will choose the smug style.

Maybe the cycle is too deeply set already. Perhaps the divide, the disdain, the whole crack-up are inevitable. But if liberal good intentions are to make a play for a better future, they cannot merely recognize the ways they've come to hate their former allies. They must begin to mend the ways they lost them in the first place.",R
"The moment of truth We must stop Trump
","Like any number of us raised in the late 20th century, I have spent my life perplexed about exactly how Hitler could have come to power in Germany. Watching Donald Trumps rise, I now understand. Leave aside whether a direct comparison of Trump to Hitler is accurate. That is not my point. My point rather is about how a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided country.

To understand the rise of Hitler and the spread of Nazism, I have generally relied on the German-Jewish migr philosopher Hannah Arendt and her arguments about the banality of evil. Somehow people can understand themselves as just doing their job, yet act as cogs in the wheel of a murderous machine. Arendt also offered a second answer in a small but powerful book called Men in Dark Times. In this book, she described all those who thought that Hitlers rise was a terrible thing but chose internal exile, or staying invisible and out of the way as their strategy for coping with the situation. They knew evil was evil, but they too facilitated it, by departing from the battlefield out of a sense of hopelessness.

One can see both of these phenomena unfolding now. The first shows itself, for instance, when journalists cover every crude and cruel thing that comes out of Trumps mouth and thereby help acculturate all of us to what we are hearing. Are they not just doing their jobs, they will ask, in covering the Republican front-runner? Have we not already been acculturated by 30 years of popular culture to offensive and inciting comments? Yes, both of these things are true. But that doesnt mean journalists ought to be Trumps megaphone. Perhaps we should just shut the lights out on offensiveness; turn off the mic when someone tries to shout down others; reestablish standards for what counts as a worthwhile contribution to the public debate. That will seem counter to journalistic norms, yes, but why not let Trump pay for his own ads when he wants to broadcast foul and incendiary ideas? Hell still have plenty of access to freedom of expression. It is time to draw a bright line.

One spots the second experience in any number of water-cooler conversations or dinner-party dialogues. Yes, yes, it is terrible. Can you believe it? Have you seen anything like it? Has America come to this? Agreed, agreed. But when someone asks what is to be done, silence falls. Very many of us, too many of us, are starting to contemplate accepting internal exile. Or we joke about moving to Canada more seriously than usually.

But over the course of the past few months, Ive learned something else that goes beyond Arendts ideas about the banality of evil and feelings of impotence in the face of danger.

Trump is rising by taking advantage of a divided country. The truth is that the vast majority of voting Americans think that Trump is unacceptable as a presidential candidate, but we are split by strong partisan ideologies and cannot coordinate a solution to stop him. Similarly, a significant part of voting Republicans think that Trump is unacceptable, but they too, thus far, have been unable to coordinate a solution. Trump is exploiting the fact that we cannot unite across our ideological divides.

The only way to stop him, then, is to achieve just that kind of coordination across party lines and across divisions within parties. We have reached that moment of truth.

Republicans, you cannot count on the Democrats to stop Trump. I believe that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination, and I intend to vote for her, but it is also the case that she is a candidate with significant weaknesses, as your party knows quite well. The result of a head-to-head contest between Clinton and Trump would be unpredictable. Trump has to be blocked in your primary.

Jeb Bush has done the right thing by dropping out, just as he did the right thing by being the first, alongside Rand Paul, to challenge Trump. The time has come, John Kasich and Ben Carson, to leave the race as well. You both express a powerful commitment to the good of your country and to its founding ideals. If you care about the future of this republic, it is time to endorse Marco Rubio. Kasich, theres a little wind in your sails, but its not enough. Your country is calling you. Do the right thing.

Ted Cruz is, I believe, pulling votes away from Trump, and for that reason is useful in the race. But, Mr. Cruz, you are drawing too close to Trumps politics. You too should change course.

Democrats, your leading candidate is too weak to count on as a firewall. She might be able to pull off a general election victory against Trump, but then again she might not. Too much is uncertain this year. You, too, need to help the Republicans beat Trump; this is no moment for standing by passively. If your deadline for changing your party affiliation has not yet come, re-register and vote for Rubio, even if, like me, you cannot stomach his opposition to marriage equality. I too would prefer Kasich as the Republican nominee, but pursuing that goal will only make it more likely that Trump takes the nomination. The republic cannot afford that.

Finally, to all of you Republicans who have already dropped out, one more, great act of public service awaits you. As candidates, you pledged to support whomever the Republican party nominated. Its time to revoke your pledge. Be bold, stand up and shout that you will not support Trump if he is your partys nominee. Do it together. Hold one big mother of a news conference. Endorse Rubio, together. It is time to draw a bright line, and you are the ones on whom this burden falls. No one else can do it.

Marco Rubio, this is also your moment to draw a bright line. You too ought to rescind your pledge to support the partys nominee if it is Trump.

Donald Trump has no respect for the basic rights that are the foundation of constitutional democracy, nor for the requirements of decency necessary to sustain democratic citizenship. Nor can any democracy survive without an expectation that the people require reasonable arguments that bring the truth to light, and Trump has nothing but contempt for our intelligence.

We, the people, need to find somewhere, buried in the recesses of our fading memories, the capacity to make common cause against this formidable threat to our equally shared liberties. The time is now.",R

This was my word: decent. Would he treat my daughter with kindness and respect? Could he be trusted to bring her home on time? In his language, actions and decisions, would he be a decent guy?

Decency mattered to me as a dad, and decency matters to Americans. We take note of the person who pays their debts. We appreciate the physician who takes time to listen. When the husband honors his wedding vows, when the teacher makes time for the struggling student, when the employee refuses to gossip about her co-worker, when the losing team congratulates the winning team, we can characterize their behavior as decent.

We appreciate decency. We applaud decency. We teach decency. We seek to develop decency.

So why isnt decency doing better in the presidential race?

The leading Republican candidate to be the next leader of the free world would not pass my decency interview. Id send him away. Id tell my daughter to stay home.

I dont know Mr. Trump. But Ive been chagrined at his antics. He ridiculed a war hero. He made a mockery of a reporters menstrual cycle. He made fun of a disabled reporter. He referred to a former first lady, Barbara Bush, as mommy and belittled Jeb Bush for bringing her on the campaign trail. He routinely calls people stupid and dummy. One writer catalogued 64 occasions that he called someone loser. These were not off-line, backstage, overheard, not-to-be-repeated comments. They were publicly and intentionally tweeted, recorded and presented.

Such insensitivities wouldnt be acceptable even for a middle school student body election. But for the Oval Office? And to do so while brandishing a Bible and boasting of his Christian faith?

I have no inside track on the intricacies of a presidential campaign. Im a pastor. I dont endorse candidates or place bumper stickers on my car. But I am protective of the Christian faith. If a public personality calls on Christ one day and calls someone a bimbo the next, is something not awry? And to do so, not once, but repeatedly, unrepentantly and unapologetically? We stand against bullying in schools. Shouldnt we do the same in presidential politics?

Could concerns be raised about other Christian candidates? Absolutely. But the concern of this article is not policy but tone and decorum. Prior presidents have exercised a restraint of the tongue. Its hard to imagine George H.W. Bush using locker room language to demean an opponent on a debate stage. I didnt vote for President Obama, but I appreciate the manner in which he has maintained the comportment of the office. At least we dont wince when he stands to speak.

When it comes to language, Mr. Trump inhabits a league of his own. Some of my friends tell me that his language is a virtue. But I respectfully part company with my Christian colleagues who chalk up his abrasive nature to candor. For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks, Jesus said. Words are a heart monitor. Christians would do well to summon any Christian leader to a higher heart standard. This includes pastors (especially this one), teachers, coaches and, by all means, presidential candidates.

All of them.

The stock explanation for Mr. Trumps success is this: He has tapped into the anger of the American people. As one man said, We are voting with our middle finger. Sounds more like a comment for a gang-fight than a presidential election. Anger-fueled reactions have caused trouble ever since Cain was angry at Abel.

We can only hope, and pray, for a return to verbal decency. Perhaps Mr. Trump will better manage his comments. (Worthy of a prayer, for sure.) Or, perhaps the American public will remember the key role of the president: to be the face of America. When he or she speaks, he or she speaks for us. Whether we agree or disagree with the policies of the president, do we not hope that they speak in a way that is consistent with the status of the office?

As far as I remember, I never turned away one of my daughters dates. They werent perfect, but they were decent fellows. That was all I could ask.

It seems that we should ask the same of these candidates.",R
"An Open Letter to My Friends Who Support Donald Trump
","m cool with you removing me from your friends list if you dont like this post. You can even disown me if you like. But Donald Trump isnt a good person, nor would he be a good president. I can understand a difference in politics. I can understand if you dont like a government run by Democrats. I can understand if you dont like certain ideologies, like Socialism. But I cant understand why you would support someone as hateful, sexist, racist and ignorant as Donald Trump.

How do you support him so blindly? Ask yourself, are you a racist, sexist, hateful and ignorant person as well? I hear his supporters saying they like him because he tells the truth, because hes so rich he can say whatever he feels like with no apologies. Just because Trump is saying these things doesnt suddenly make them right. Its not okay to discriminate against an entire religion based on a small percentage of its followers who have become terrorists by twisting the words of the religion to fit their crazy ideals. Its not okay to marginalize an entire race of people, saying things like all the Mexicans are lazy, that they are all stealing our jobs and bringing drugs into our country.

White people also have bad apples. So does every race of people. Were all human. Some humans are really bad people. Some are really good. And it doesnt matter what color they are, it makes no difference whatsoever. Trump says he is just telling the truth. But whose truth? There are lazy people in every race and there are dangerous violent people in every race and every religion. Kicking all Muslims out of the country is not the answer, nor is it the acceptable behavior of a person in an extremely powerful position, like the President of the United States.

The Japanese Internment camps were wrong, Segregation was wrong, Slavery was wrong. We fought wars amongst ourselves to rise above racism and hatred. In WWII more than 60 million people died worldwide. Why? Because of twisted people who were whipping up the population into a frenzy and making ridiculous statements, killing innocent people simply because of their race or religion. The United States lost more than 400,000 lives fighting in that war, against the same ideas that Trump is pushing. The idea that certain religions are more dangerous than others and the idea that people should be judged based on the color of their skin rather than the content of their character.

They always say its so important to make your voice heard, to get out and vote. But Im not sure if its ever been more important than now.
Were still healing from the damage inflicted by the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Iraq and the War on Terror. And it isnt just ISIS or Al-Qaeda. Its our own people in this country killing their fellow countrymen over differences of opinion, like whether or not you believe abortion is okay or what kind of political ideology you support. And then there are just the plainly insane people who finally snap and go on shooting rampages for no discernible reason at all. They just went mad.

The kind of leadership Trump is displaying is irresponsible and dangerous. His virulent ideas are seeping into the brains of his supporters. Supporters who think its okay to say things like light the mother@!$%#er on fire while a protester is being dragged out of one of his rallies. Maybe the protester was wrong to be where he was at the time, but no matter what he did, there was no reason to set him on fire. In fact, there is NEVER a reason to set anyone on fire. Unless its because they are dead and they wish to be cremated.

Trumps supporters are angry, and anger is infectious. I can tell you as a non-supporter of Trump I am just as angry. We need the kind of leader that seeks to bring us together, not tear us apart. Why do we have to fight against helping each other, against common sense, against a united Nation? The American Dream is a nightmare and we are feeding it, making it worse every day. Trump is a bully, a loud mouth, ignorant, sexist, racist, disgusting example of how horrible humans can potentially be.

He is the crazy person at your dinner table who wont stop running his mouth. The only reason he is allowed to carry on with his ugly hateful rhetoric is because you have too much respect for Grandma to get into a fist fight in her home. Hes the guy you have to endure until he leaves, all the while hating every minute that you have to occupy the same space. Lucky for us, this isnt Grandmas house, so feel free to punch him in the mouth in the form of getting out and making your vote count.

They always say its so important to make your voice heard, to get out and vote. But Im not sure if its ever been more important than now. Differences of political ideals are one thing, I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics, but racism isnt one of them, neither is hate, neither is the belittling of women or the judgment of others based on their appearance or their disability, or their sexual preference.

By supporting Trump do you think things will go back to the way they were? Back when gay people had to hide in fear, back when people of any other color than white had to worry about getting lynched, back when it was okay to openly hate? Do you think empowered women will suddenly quit their jobs and go back to the kitchen ? Because electing Trump wont make any of that come true. Were past that as a nation, or at least I thought we were.

I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics, but racism isnt one of them, neither is hate, neither is the belittling of women...
If youre not a racist, bigoted, misogynistic jerk, then voting for Trump simply because you dont like Democrats is wrong. If you are one of his supporters and youre just a racist and you dont care who knows it then vote for him, but know that the good people of America will not stand for it and he will never win a fair election. And please consider pursuing an education and work on your empathy toward your fellow human beings. Whatever led you to believe that racism is okay can be unlearned if you open your mind. Im sorry that you were raised to believe that you deserve better treatment than the rest of the people on the planet that have different views than yours, worship different gods than you and have skin that isnt white.

To all the people, of all the races and religions that Donald Trump stands against, to all the women that dont meet his standards of beauty, to all the good Muslims, and Christians, Mormons and Catholics and Jewish, Italians, Irish and Asians, to the African-Americans and Native Americans, to anyone who has ever been persecuted, belittled, made to feel inferior or bullied based on ignorance like the kind that Trump is spewing, please, I implore you to get out and vote against him. Dont let the progress of this great nation be halted. Weve come too far.

In this country we FIGHT and DIE for freedom, for Truth and Justice. We fight for whats right. And what Trump is doing and saying isnt right. Some have attributed the following statement to Abraham Lincoln*:

I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and cause me to tremble for safety of my country; corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in High Places will follow, and the Money Power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the People, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the Republic destroyed.

And he couldnt be more right. Trump IS the one percent, he IS working on your prejudices, and he WILL destroy the Republic if he is elected, make no doubt about it.

If you dont believe me, just look at the level of crazy coming out of his own mouth:

[I am] calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representatives can figure out what is going on  Donald Trump. Thats religious discrimination.

An extremely credible source has called my office and told me that Barack Obamas birth certificate is a fraud  Donald Trump. Thats an outright lie.

Arianna Huffington is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man - he made a good decision.  Donald Trump. This is sexism, and just plain rude.

You know, it really doesnt matter what the media write as long as youve got a young, and beautiful, piece of @!$%#. - Donald Trump. This is misogyny at its finest.

I will build a great wall  and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me  and Ill build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. - Donald Trump. The words of an arrogant hate monger.

When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending the best. Theyre not sending you, theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us. Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists... And some, I assume, are good people.  Donald Trump. Racist.

Our great African-American President hasnt exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore.  Donald Trump. Racist.

If I were running The View, Id fire Rosie ODonnell. I mean, Id look at her right in that fat, ugly face of hers, Id say Rosie, youre fired.  Donald Trump. The words of an @!$%#.

The beauty of me is that Im very rich. - Donald Trump. So Vain.

Its freezing and snowing in New York - we need global warming! - Donald Trump. Ignorant.

My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my body. - Donald Trump. Gross.

I think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that Im more honest and my women are beautiful. - Donald Trump. Sexist. As if women are possessions rather than people. And also a lie. A lie about how honest he is.

How can you support this man?

*I am aware of the fact that snopes.com claims the Lincoln Capitalism Prophecy quote is false. Its a quote that has been going around for more than a hundred years. The quote has also been attributed to a letter that Lincoln supposedly wrote to Col. William F. Elkins in 1864. Scholars have cited The Lincoln Encyclopedia: The Spoken and Written Words of A. Lincoln Arranged for Ready Reference by Archer H. Shaw. Snopes still claims the letter referred to in this encyclopedia is a fraud, forged by Emanuel Hertz in his book Abraham Lincoln: A New Portrait. So in the interest of full disclosure, these may or may not have been Lincolns words. Whether they were written by Hertz or Lincoln, they were still written and they still pertain to the point I was trying to make. Income inequality is a serious issue in this country, and Donald Trump is working on the prejudices of the people.",R

"Why Do We Hear More About Hillary's Emails Than Donald Trump's Rape Allegations
","I dont know about you, but Im getting tired of 2016 presidential election media coverage. Its been a mess since the beginning, when Donald Trump kicked off his campaign with the statement that Mexicans are rapists, and major news channels and newspapers responded by giving him just what he wanted: more coverage than any other candidate.

For months I maintained the position that if we all stopped clicking on Donald Trump headlines, he would go away. But no one was interested in that strategy, and now its too late to implement it. The media played a major role in Donald Trumps rise to power, and now it seems as though they are rooting for him to maintain it.

Two weeks ago, a woman filed a federal lawsuit against Donald Trump, alleging that he raped her in 1994, when she was 13 years old. Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit is Jeffrey Epstein, a man who has already served a year in prison for soliciting an underage prostitute, and who was recently described by Donald Trump as a terrific guy.

This story was first reported on June 20th by The Real Deal, a publication dedicated to covering New York real estate news. It was picked up by Gothamist, The Daily Beast, Snopes, and a few other websites. I did not learn about the case until a friend of mine shared this Huffington Post blog about it. The case was not covered in Huffington Posts news section, nor in the news section of any major publication.

Meanwhile, I received two New York Times push notifications this week with updates about Hillary Clintons emails.

Has the media decided Donald Trump is just so despicable that it isnt worth covering another atrocity allegedly perpetrated by him, while Hillary Clinton is expected to be a perfect human being, so more coverage of her emails serves the public good? Have they decided Donald Trump is just so immune to negative coverage that reporting this lawsuit is a waste of time, while another story on Hillarys email server is guaranteed to make her even more unpopular?

Or, is giving credence to rape accusations against powerful men still socially unacceptable? (Re: Peyton Manning)

Its difficult for me not to think that sexism has a hand in guiding the medias wacky priority list. I know a lot of people are getting tired of accusations of sexism in this presidential race, but sexism would explain why a female candidate sending emails from a private server faces a thousand times more public scrutiny than a male candidate allegedly raping a child.

To reiterate what has already been determined about Hillarys emails: Federal law did not prohibit public officials from using private email accounts until 2014, after she left office, and none of her emails were considered classified at the time she sent them via a private server. And yet, Hillary is branded a criminal, while Donald Trumpwho has now had three legal claims of sexual assault filed against himremains the successful businessman whose greatest offense is his ego. 

You can counter that the claims of sexual assault against Donald Trump are unproven in a court of law, and to that I will counter that Hillary has not been convicted of any crimes either. In this country, the principle of innocent until proven guilty tends to serve the privileged. That principle goes out the window when we discuss accusations against women and people of color.

Donald Trump may be a megalomaniac who has no experience in public office and has shocked the entire world by making it this far in the race, but the absurdity of his candidacy does not mean that he should be vetted less critically than his opponent. He may be a racist and a misogynist from whom we can never expect anything but the worst, but the reality is that hes one election away from being the most powerful person on the planet. If we dismiss his transgressions as just being typical of his character, we may allow him to actually hold that power in his hands.

To all the media gatekeepers out there: If you are frustrated by the fact that criticisms of Donald Trump do not dissuade his supporters in the slightest, I sympathize with you. But your frustration is not an excuse for failing to deliver those criticisms which Trump deserves. Perhaps this latest development would have no effect on Trumps poll numbers, but it still needs to be covered. This is information that the public needs to know.",R
"Trump I Will Protect Our LGBTQ Citizens'
","Despite an RNC platform that is overwhelmingly anti-gay, Donald Trump in his speech on Thursday mentioned the Orlando massacre and said that he ""will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of the hateful, foreign ideology, believe me,"" in reference to fundamentalist Islamic.

The line was met with loud applause from the presumably conservative crowd and Trump noted, ""I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said, thank you.""",R
"Donald and Billy on the Bus
","Its Billy Bushs snickering that really gets to me. In the video from 2005, published Friday by The Washington Post, you can hear Mr. Bush (first cousin to George W.) wheezing ecstatically as Donald J. Trump brags, inadvertently into a hot mic, about sexually harassing and groping women. The pair, along with a passel of unidentified men, are on a bus en route to film an Access Hollywood segment with the actress Arianne Zucker.

Through the window of the bus, Mr. Bush seems to spot Ms. Zucker first, as she waits to greet them. Sheesh, he blurts, breathless, telling Mr. Trump how hot your girl is. You can feel Mr. Bushs giddiness, a contact high, at getting to join a more powerful man in the oldest and most sacred of male bonding exercises: objectifying women.

Mr. Trump spies Ms. Zucker too. Whoa!

Yes! Mr. Bush grunts, Beavis-esque, Yes, the Donald has scored!

Of course, the Donald has not scored. The Donald is on the NBC lot to shoot a guest appearance on Days of Our Lives at the behest of his employer to promote his reality show, The Apprentice, while Access Hollywood produces an accompanying puff piece. This is work within work within work. Mr. Bush is at work. Mr. Trump is at work. Ms. Zucker is at work, and not only is she not Mr. Trumps girl, she is a complete stranger who is also on camera and being paid to smile.

Donald Trumps Lewd Comments About Women
Publish Date October 7, 2016. Photo by Mark Makela for The New York Times. Watch in Times Video 
I gotta use some Tic Tacs, Mr. Trump says, still inside the bus, just in case I start kissing her. You know Im automatically attracted to beautiful  I just start kissing them, its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait. And when youre a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything. Mr. Bush and the bus toadies laugh.

You cant do anything, actually. This might be a challenging concept for someone running a campaign so socially retrograde its practically medieval, but women are allowed to own property now. That includes our own bodies, whether you feel automatically entitled to pieces of us or not.

Every woman knows a version of Donald Trump. Most of us have known more of them than we can (or care to) recall. Hes the boss who thinks you owe him something; the date who thinks that silence means yes and no means try harder; the stranger who thinks your bodys mere existence constitutes an invitation to touch, take, own and destroy. Hes every deadbeat hookup, every narcissistic loser, every man whos ever tried to leverage power, money, fame, credibility or physical strength to snap your boundaries like matchsticks. He is hot fear and cold dread and a pit in your stomach. Hes the man who held you back, who never took you seriously, who treated you like nothing until you started to believe it, who raped you and told you it was your fault and whose daddy was a cop so who would believe you anyway?

Come on, women. You know this man. I can name the ones in my past  name yours and imagine each as president, with every womans life in his care. Would you even trust him to watch your dog? (Thats a trick question because he would never do it. His defining characteristic is that he does not care about you.)

When Mr. Trump tells Mr. Bush that hes gotta use a Tic Tac just in case he cannot restrain himself from non-consensually affixing his perfectly round, gasping lamprey mouth over Ms. Zuckers, he is talking about sexually assaulting a co-worker.

When he says he grabs womens genitals, he is talking about sexually assaulting anyone he feels like, at any time. Female Trump voters: Its fine if youve come to terms with not being a full human being in the eyes of your party, but what about your daughters? Is that the life you want for them? You want old men to grab their genitals? You want the president of the United States to go around grabbing genitals?

Mr. Trump is rape cultures blathering id, and Sunday night Hillary Clinton (who, no doubt, has just as many man-made scars as the rest of us) has to stand next to him on a stage, and remain unflappable as shes held to an astronomically higher standard, and pretend that he is her equal while his followers persist in howling that sexism is a feminist myth. While Mr. Trump boasts about sexual assault and vows to suppress disobedient media, cable news pundits spend their time taking a protractor to Mrs. Clintons smile  a constant, churning, microanalysis of nothing.

Many people, well, many men, are expressing their disgust with Mr. Trump the only way they know how: By invoking their mothers and daughters and sisters  people, presumably, with the anatomy Mr. Trump feels free to assess and knead. Hillary Clinton has been showing us all year, and all her life, that, sure, women can be cherished if you want, but they also can be president.

Meanwhile, right-wing lawmakers are scrambling, sanctimonious and pathetic, to distance themselves from their own hideous progeny, clearly hoping to salvage some personal credibility and perhaps even save their party. But here is the thing, the big thing, that Paul D. Ryan and Reince Priebus and Mike Pence and all the spineless Billy Bushes of the world (and plenty of progressive men too, for that matter) dont understand: Most of you are no better than Mr. Trump; you are just more subtle.

If you have spent your career brutalizing and dehumanizing women legislatively rather than personally, you are no better. If you were happy to overlook months of violent racism, xenophobia, transphobia and Islamophobia from the Trump campaign, but now youre mad that he used a bad word and tried to sleep with another mans wife, you are no better. If you have derided and stigmatized identity politics in an effort to keep the marginalized from organizing, you are no better. If you snicker or say nothing while your fellow men behave like Donald Trump, you are no better.

The truth is that all of you have failed women for generations, and you deserve to lose our votes. Next month we will grab you where it hurts. By your ballots.",R
"Donald Trump is a unique threat to American democracy
","DONALD J. TRUMP, until now a Republican problem, this week became a challenge the nation must confront and overcome. The real estate tycoon is uniquely unqualified to serve as president, in experience and temperament. He is mounting a campaign of snarl and sneer, not substance. To the extent he has views, they are wrong in their diagnosis of Americas problems and dangerous in their proposed solutions. Mr. Trumps politics of denigration and division could strain the bonds that have held a diverse nation together. His contempt for constitutional norms might reveal the nations two-century-old experiment in checks and balances to be more fragile than we knew.

Any one of these characteristics would be disqualifying; together, they make Mr. Trump a peril. We recognize that this is not the usual moment to make such a statement. In an ordinary election year, we would acknowledge the Republican nominee, move on to the Democratic convention and spend the following months, like other voters, evaluating the candidates performance in debates, on the stump and in position papers. This year we will follow the campaign as always, offering honest views on all the candidates. But we cannot salute the Republican nominee or pretend that we might endorse him this fall. A Trump presidency would be dangerous for the nation and the world.

Why are we so sure? Start with experience. It has been 64 years since a major party nominated anyone for president who did not have electoral experience. That experiment turned out pretty well  but Mr. Trump, to put it mildly, is no Dwight David Eisenhower. Leading the Allied campaign to liberate Europe from the Nazis required strategic and political skills of the first order, and Eisenhower  though he liked to emphasize his common touch as he faced the intellectual Democrat Adlai Stevenson  was shrewd, diligent, humble and thoughtful.

In contrast, there is nothing on Mr. Trumps rsum to suggest he could function successfully in Washington. He was staked in the family business by a well-to-do father and has pursued a career marked by some real estate successes, some failures and repeated episodes of saving his own hide while harming people who trusted him. Given his continuing refusal to release his tax returns, breaking with a long bipartisan tradition, it is only reasonable to assume there are aspects of his record even more discreditable than what we know.

The lack of experience might be overcome if Mr. Trump saw it as a handicap worth overcoming. But he displays no curiosity, reads no books and appears to believe he needs no advice. In fact, what makes Mr. Trump so unusual is his combination of extreme neediness and unbridled arrogance. He is desperate for affirmation but contemptuous of other views. He also is contemptuous of fact. Throughout the campaign, he has unspooled one lie after another  that Muslims in New Jersey celebrated after 9/11, that his tax-cut plan would not worsen the deficit, that he opposed the Iraq War before it started  and when confronted with contrary evidence, he simply repeats the lie. It is impossible to know whether he convinces himself of his own untruths or knows that he is wrong and does not care. It is also difficult to know which trait would be more frightening in a commander in chief.

Given his ignorance, it is perhaps not surprising that Mr. Trump offers no coherence when it comes to policy. In years past, he supported immigration reform, gun control and legal abortion; as candidate, he became a hard-line opponent of all three. Even in the course of the campaign, he has flip-flopped on issues such as whether Muslims should be banned from entering the United States and whether women who have abortions should be punished . Worse than the flip-flops is the absence of any substance in his agenda. Existing trade deals are stupid, but Mr. Trump does not say how they could be improved. The Islamic State must be destroyed, but the candidate offers no strategy for doing so. Eleven million undocumented immigrants must be deported, but Mr. Trump does not tell us how he would accomplish this legally or practically.

What the candidate does offer is a series of prejudices and gut feelings, most of them erroneous. Allies are taking advantage of the United States. Immigrants are committing crimes and stealing jobs. Muslims hate America. In fact, Japan and South Korea are major contributors to an alliance that has preserved a peace of enormous benefit to Americans. Immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans and take jobs that no one else will. Muslims are the primary victims of Islamist terrorism, and Muslim Americans, including thousands who have served in the military, are as patriotic as anyone else.

[Fareed Zakaria: America would be Trumps banana republic]

The Trump litany of victimization has resonated with many Americans whose economic prospects have stagnated. They deserve a serious champion, and the challenges of inequality and slow wage growth deserve a serious response. But Mr. Trump has nothing positive to offer, only scapegoats and dark conspiracy theories. He launched his campaign by accusing Mexico of sending rapists across the border, and similar hatefulness has surfaced numerous times in the year since.

In a dangerous world, Mr. Trump speaks blithely of abandoning NATO, encouraging more nations to obtain nuclear weapons and cozying up to dictators who in fact wish the United States nothing but harm. For eight years, Republicans have criticized President Obama for apologizing for America and for weakening alliances. Now they put forward a candidate who mimics the vilest propaganda of authoritarian adversaries about how terrible the United States is and how unfit it is to lecture others. He has made clear that he would drop allies without a second thought. The consequences to global security could be disastrous.

Most alarming is Mr. Trumps contempt for the Constitution and the unwritten democratic norms upon which our system depends. He doesnt know what is in the nations founding document. When asked by a member of Congress about Article I, which enumerates congressional powers, the candidate responded, I am going to abide by the Constitution whether its number 1, number 2, number 12, number 9. The charter has seven articles.

Worse, he doesnt seem to care about its limitations on executive power. He has threatened that those who criticize him will suffer when he is president. He has vowed to torture suspected terrorists and bomb their innocent relatives, no matter the illegality of either act. He has vowed to constrict the independent press. He went after a judge whose rulings angered him, exacerbating his contempt for the independence of the judiciary by insisting that the judge should be disqualified because of his Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump has encouraged and celebrated violence at his rallies. The U.S. democratic system is strong and has proved resilient when it has been tested before. We have faith in it. But to elect Mr. Trump would be to knowingly subject it to threat.

Mr. Trump campaigns by insult and denigration, insinuation and wild accusation: Ted Cruzs father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; Hillary Clinton may be guilty of murder; Mr. Obama is a traitor who wants Muslims to attack. The Republican Party has moved the lunatic fringe onto center stage, with discourse that renders impossible the kind of substantive debate upon which any civil democracy depends.

Most responsible Republican leaders know all this to be true; that is why Mr. Trump had to rely so heavily on testimonials by relatives and employees during this weeks Republican convention. With one exception (Bob Dole), the living Republican presidents and presidential nominees of the past three decades all stayed away. But most current officeholders, even those who declared Mr. Trump to be an unthinkable choice only months ago, have lost the courage to speak out.

The partys failure of judgment leaves the nations future where it belongs, in the hands of voters. Many Americans do not like either candidate this year . We have criticized the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in the past and will do so again when warranted. But we do not believe that she (or the Libertarian and Green party candidates, for that matter) represents a threat to the Constitution. Mr. Trump is a unique and present danger.",R
"John Oliver has the Donald Trump takedown America has been waiting for
","On Sunday's Last Week Tonight, John Oliver finally took on billionaire Donald Trump.

""I get that the character of Donald Trump is entertaining, and that he says things that people want to hear,"" Oliver said. ""And I know that his very name is powerful.""

But Oliver argued that Trump isn't what he seems. Here are some of the qualities many supporters have listed about Trump  and Oliver's counterpoints:

""He tells it like it is"": ""Does he? Because the website PolitiFact checked 77 of his statements, and rated 76 percent of them as varying degrees of false.""
""He is truly independent and not beholden to anyone"": ""While it is true that he hasn't taken corporate money, the implication that he has personally spent $20 to $25 million is a bit of a stretch, because what he's actually done is loaned his own campaign $17.5 million and has just personally given just $250,000. And that's important, because up until the convention he can pay himself back for the loan with campaign funds.""
""He's tough"": ""For a tough guy, he has incredibly thin skin. Back in 1988, Spy magazine called him a short-fingered vulgarian. And ever since, the editor Graydon Carter says he receives envelopes from Trump, always with a photo on which he circled his hand to highlight the length of his fingers, usually with a note reading, 'See, not so short!'""
""His success"": ""While yes, he has made more money than most of us will make in a lifetime, not only did he get a multimillion-dollar inheritance from his father, but he's also lost a huge amount."" 

Oliver then played a clip of Trump's daughter saying, ""I remember once my father and I were walking down Fifth Avenue and there was a homeless person sitting right outside of Trump Tower. And I remember my father pointing to him and saying, 'You know, that guy has $8 billion more than me.' Because he was in such extreme debt at that point.""
Oliver also noted one other issue with Trump: He's wildly inconsistent. ""He's been pro-choice and pro-life, for and against assault weapon bans, in favor of both bringing in Syrian refugees and deporting them out of the country.""

Or take Trump's inconsistent statements on former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke's endorsement of Trump. To CNN, Trump said, ""I don't know anything about David Duke. Okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists.""

Oliver was not having it, pointing to Trump's past remarks to journalists: ""Really? That's your best answer there? Because you definitely know who he is  partly because you called him 'a bigot' and 'a racist' in the past.""

Oliver concluded that the best way to take down Trump is to uncouple him from his brand  his name. And it turns out that the Trump family's name was once Drumpf. Oliver explained how this could work:

If you are thinking of voting for Donald Trump, the charismatic guy promising to make America great again, stop and take a moment to imagine how you would feel if you just met a guy named Donald Drumpf, a litigious serial liar with a string of broken business ventures and the support of a former Klan leader who he can't decide whether or not to condemn. Would you think he would make a good president, or is the spell now somewhat broken?
""That is why tonight I am asking America to make Donald Drumpf again,"" Oliver added.

Oliver then announced the launch of the #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain and the website DonaldJDrumpf.com, where anyone can download a browser extension that replaces Trump's name with Drumpf.

""We cannot keep getting blinded by the magic of his name,"" Oliver said. ""So please, don't think of him as Donald Trump. Think of him as something else.""",R
"Ford fact checks Trump We will be here forever
","Ford has a message to Donald Trump: We're not going anywhere.
The automaker quickly shot down Donald Trump's latest hyperbolic claim, made on Fox News Thursday, that Ford plans to ""fire all its employees in the United States"" as part of a plan to build a plant in Mexico.
Ford said there will be zero job losses in the U.S. as a result of the new plant in Mexico. The Wayne, Michigan, plant that now builds the Focus and C-Max that will move to Mexico will instead start building other models -- probably the new Ford Bronco SUV and Ranger small pickup.
""Ford has been in the United States for more than 100 years. Our home is here. We will be here forever,"" said spokeswoman Christine Baker.
The company has 85,000 U.S. employees, up 28,000, or nearly 50%, in just the last five years. It has 8,800 employees at Mexican plants, and will add 2,800 jobs there when the new $1.6 billion plant opens there in 2018.
Ford committed to build new vehicles at the Michigan Assembly Plant to take the place of the Focus and C-Max when it reached a new contract late last year with the United Auto Workers union, which represents 3,900 hourly workers at the plant.
And while Ford is shifting production of all small cars to Mexico, it will continue to make many car models at U.S. plants, including the iconic Mustang.
Related: Ford moving all small car production to Mexico
The small cars Ford is shifting to Mexico are less popular and less profitable models.
Trump has been using Ford for months as a prime example of what's wrong with U.S. trade policy, but Ford has been strongly rebutting the GOP nominee.
The issue surfaced again on Wednesday when a Ford executive, speaking at a conference for investors, reiterated the company's plans to move its small car production to Mexico.
Related: 'President Trump' would cost U.S. economy $1 trillion
During a Fox News interview, Trump vowed to impose a 35% tax on cars built in Mexico if they're shipped back to the U.S.
""They think they're going to get away with this and they fire all their employees in the United States and...move to Mexico,"" said Trump. ""When that car comes back across the border into our country that now comes in free, we're gonna charge them a 35% tax. And you know what's gonna happen, they're never going to leave.""",R
"New Kasich ad If Trump becomes president you better hope there's someone left to help you
","The gloves are off in the fight between John Kasich and Donald Trump.

Well, technically they've been off since last Friday. But the Kasich campaign released a Web ad Tuesday directly attacked Trump with a darker tone than any other candidate has used so far to go after the business mogul.

The spot features retired Air Force Col. Tom Moe speaking at an event in Ohio, the same day Trump held a rally in Columbus. Moe, who the Kasich campaign identifies as a former Vietnam POW, paraphrases a quote from Protestant pastor Martin Niemller, taken from his lectures after World War II.

""You might not care if Donald Trump says Muslims should register with their government, because you're not one,"" says Moe, to an ominous soundtrack. ""And you might not care if Donald Trump says he's going to round up all the Hispanic immigrants, because you're not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump says it's okay to rough up black protesters, because you're not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump wants to suppress journalists, because you're not one. But think about this: If he keeps going, and he actually becomes president, he might just get around to you. And you better hope there's someone left to help you.""

The new spot came just a day after both the campaign and the super PAC supporting Kasich released a pair of spots attacking the GOP front-runner -- and hours after the candidates' latest Twitter spat:

Later Monday, Kasich wound up a day-long anti-Trump tweetstorm with a challenge:",R
"Why Donald Trump Should Not Be President
","When Donald Trump began his improbable run for president 15 months ago, he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about Mexican rapists flooding across the Southern border.

From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trumps views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.

Now here stands Mr. Trump, feisty from his runaway Republican primary victories and ready for the first presidential debate, scheduled for Monday night, with Hillary Clinton. It is time for others who are still undecided, and perhaps hoping for some dramatic change in our politics and governance, to take a hard look and see Mr. Trump for who he is. They have an obligation to scrutinize his supposed virtues as a refreshing counterpolitician. Otherwise, they could face the consequences of handing the White House to a man far more consumed with himself than with the nations well-being.

Heres how Mr. Trump is selling himself and why he cant be believed.

SEE ALL COMMENTS
Despite his towering properties, Mr. Trump has a record rife with bankruptcies and sketchy ventures like Trump University, which authorities are investigating after numerous complaints of fraud. His name has been chiseled off his failed casinos in Atlantic City.

Mr. Trumps brazen refusal to disclose his tax returns  as Mrs. Clinton and other nominees for decades have done  should sharpen voter wariness of his business and charitable operations. Disclosure would undoubtedly raise numerous red flags; the public record already indicates that in at least some years he made full use of available loopholes and paid no taxes.

Mr. Trump has been opaque about his questionable global investments in Russia and elsewhere, which could present conflicts of interest as president, particularly if his business interests are left in the hands of his children, as he intends. Investigations have found self-dealing. He notably tapped $258,000 in donors money from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits involving his for-profit businesses, according to The Washington Post.

A straight talker who tells it like it is?

Mr. Trump, who has no experience in national security, declares that he has a plan to soundly defeat the Islamic State militants in Syria, but wont reveal it, bobbing and weaving about whether he would commit ground troops. Voters cannot judge whether he has any idea what hes talking about without an outline of his plan, yet Mr. Trump ludicrously insists he must not tip off the enemy.

Another of his cornerstone proposals  his campaign pledge of a total and complete shutdown of Muslim newcomers plus the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants across a border wall paid for by Mexico  has been subjected to endless qualifications as he zigs and zags in pursuit of middle-ground voters.

Whatever his gyrations, Mr. Trump always does make clear where his heart lies  with the anti-immigrant, nativist and racist signals that he scurrilously employed to build his base.",R
"A Week of Whoppers From Donald Trump
","All politicians bend the truth to fit their purposes, including Hillary Clinton. But Donald J. Trump has unleashed a blizzard of falsehoods, exaggerations and outright lies in the general election, peppering his speeches, interviews and Twitter posts with untruths so frequent that they can seem flighty or random  even compulsive.

However, a closer examination, over the course of a week, revealed an unmistakable pattern: Virtually all of Mr. Trumps falsehoods directly bolstered a powerful and self-aggrandizing narrative depicting him as a heroic savior for a nation menaced from every direction. Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, described the practice as creating an unreality bubble that he surrounds himself with.

The New York Times closely tracked Mr. Trumps public statements from Sept. 15-21, and assembled a list of his 31 biggest whoppers, many of them uttered repeatedly. This total excludes dozens more: Untruths that appeared to be mere hyperbole or humor, or delivered purely for effect, or what could generously be called rounding errors. Mr. Trumps campaign, which dismissed this compilation as silly, offered responses on every point, but in none of the following instances did the responses support his assertions.

Tall Tales About Himself

Mr. Trumps version of reality allows for few, if any, flaws in himself. As he tells it, the polls are always looking up, his policy solutions are painless and simple and his judgment regarding politics and people has been consistent  and flawless. The most consistent falsehood he tells about himself may be that he opposed the war in Iraq from the start, when the evidence shows otherwise.

1He said a supportive crowd chanted, Let him speak! when a black pastor in Flint, Mich., asked Mr. Trump not to give a political speech in the church.
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 15.
There were no such chants.
2I was against going into the war in Iraq.
SPEECH IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 19.
This is not getting any truer with repetition. He never publicly expressed opposition to the war before it began, and he made supportive remarks to Howard Stern.
3He said any supportive comments he made about the Iraq war came long before the war began.
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.

Unfounded Claims About
Critics and the News Media

Its not just Mrs. Clinton whom Mr. Trump belittles and tars with inaccurate information. He also distorted the facts about his Republican critics, including President George Bush and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. And he claimed that Lester Holt, the NBC anchor moderating the first presidential debate, is a Democrat  but Mr. Holt is a registered Republican.

13In the primaries, Mr. Kasich won one and, by the way, didnt win it by much  that was Ohio.
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 19.
Mr. Kasich crushed him in Ohio, winning by 11 percentage points.
14Lester Holt, the NBC anchor and debate moderator, is a Democrat.
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 19.
Mr. Holt is a registered Republican, New York City records show.
15The presidential debate moderators are all Democrats. Its a very unfair system.
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 19.
Only one, Chris Wallace of Fox News, is a registered Democrat.
16He said it hasnt been reported that Mrs. Clinton called some Trump supporters deplorable.
SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.
It would be difficult to find a news organization that didnt report her remark.
Inaccurate Claims About Clinton

Mr. Trump regularly dissembles about his opponent, attributing ideas to Mrs. Clinton that she has not endorsed, or accusing her of complicity in events in which she had no involvement.

17Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it.
REMARKS IN WASHINGTON, SEPT. 16.
Mrs. Clinton and her campaign never publicly questioned President Obamas birthplace; Mr. Trump made it his signature cause for five years.
18Mrs. Clinton had the power and the duty to stop the release of unauthorized immigrants whose home countries would not accept their deportation after they were released from prison.
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN COLORADO, SEPT. 17, AND FLORIDA, SEPT. 19.
The secretary of state does not have the power to detain convicted criminals after they have served their sentences, and has little power to make foreign countries accept deportees.
19Mrs. Clinton has not criticized jihadists and foreign governments that oppress and kill women, gay people and non-Muslims. Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? No.
SPEECH IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 19.
She has denounced jihadists and foreign countries on the same grounds, if not necessarily using the same words.
20Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies  she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.
TWITTER, SEPT. 20.
He did not invent the tarmac rally or the campaign-plane backdrop.
21Mrs. Clinton destroyed 13 smartphones with a hammer while she was secretary of state.
SPEECHES IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 15 AND SEPT. 19.
An aide told the F.B.I. of only two occasions in which phones were destroyed with a hammer.
22He said Mrs. Clinton is calling for total amnesty in the first 100 days, including a virtual end to immigration enforcement and for unauthorized immigrants to receive Social Security and Medicare.
SPEECH IN COLORADO, SEPT. 17.
She has not proposed this.
23Mrs. Clinton is effectively proposing to abolish the borders around the country.
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN TEXAS, SEPT. 17.
She is not even proposing to cut funding for the Border Patrol.
24Hillary Clintons plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term alone, and would cost $400 billion.
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.
She endorsed admitting 65,000 Syrian refugees this year, on top of other admissions. Mr. Trump is falsely claiming that she wants to do this every year and is estimating the cost accordingly.
Stump Speech Falsehoods

Some warped or inaccurate claims have become regular features of Mr. Trumps stump speech. He routinely overstates the scale and nature of the countrys economic distress and the threats to its national security, and exaggerates the potential for overnight improvements if he were elected.

25Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that theyve ever been in before  ever, ever, ever.
SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.
No measurement supports this characterization of black America.
26Fifty-eight percent of black youth are not working.
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 16, AND COLORADO, SEPT. 17.
This misleading statistic counts high school students as out of work. Black youth unemployment actually was 20.6 percent in July.
27Many dangerous refugees are being welcomed by the Obama administration. Hundreds of thousands of people are being approved to pour into the country. We have no idea who they are.
NEW HAMPSHIRE SPEECH, SEPT. 15.
The Obama administration has admitted more than 10,000 Syrian refugees, using an extensive screening process.
28We have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan.
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 16; COLORADO, SEPT. 17; NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20; OHIO, SEPT. 21; AND A FOX NEWS INTERVIEW ON SEPT. 21.
No American city resembles a war zone, though crime has risen lately in some, like Chicago. Urban violence has fallen precipitously over the past 25 years.
29Ford plans to cut American jobs by relocating small-car production to Mexico, and may move all production outside the United States.
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW AND NEW HAMPSHIRE SPEECH, SEPT. 15.
Mark Fields, Fords chief executive, said it was not cutting American jobs.
30We have a trade deficit this year with China of approximately $500 billion.
NORTH CAROLINA SPEECH, SEPT. 20.
He has made this claim repeatedly, but the trade deficit with China is significantly smaller.
Esoteric Embellishments

Mr. Trump often dissembles on subjects of passing interest, like the news of the day or the parochial concerns of his local audiences. But his larger pattern of behavior still holds: These misstatements, too, accentuate the grievances of his supporters, and cast his own ideas in a more favorable light.

31Senator Bernie Sanders fell victim to a rigged system with the superdelegates.
SPEECHES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SEPT. 15, AND NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.
Mr. Sanders did not lose the Democratic nomination because of superdelegates. Mrs. Clinton beat him in pledged delegates, too.

"The Governing Cancer of Our Time
","We live in a big, diverse society. There are essentially two ways to maintain order and get things done in such a society  politics or some form of dictatorship. Either through compromise or brute force. Our founding fathers chose politics.

Politics is an activity in which you recognize the simultaneous existence of different groups, interests and opinions. You try to find some way to balance or reconcile or compromise those interests, or at least a majority of them. You follow a set of rules, enshrined in a constitution or in custom, to help you reach these compromises in a way everybody considers legitimate.

The downside of politics is that people never really get everything they want. Its messy, limited and no issue is ever really settled. Politics is a muddled activity in which people have to recognize restraints and settle for less than they want. Disappointment is normal.

But thats sort of the beauty of politics, too. It involves an endless conversation in which we learn about other people and see things from their vantage point and try to balance their needs against our own. Plus, its better than the alternative: rule by some authoritarian tyrant who tries to govern by clobbering everyone in his way.

As Bernard Crick wrote in his book, In Defence of Politics, Politics is a way of ruling divided societies without undue violence.

Over the past generation we have seen the rise of a group of people who are against politics. These groups  best exemplified by the Tea Party but not exclusive to the right  want to elect people who have no political experience. They want outsiders. They delegitimize compromise and deal-making. Theyre willing to trample the customs and rules that give legitimacy to legislative decision-making if it helps them gain power.

Ultimately, they dont recognize other people. They suffer from a form of political narcissism, in which they dont accept the legitimacy of other interests and opinions. They dont recognize restraints. They want total victories for themselves and their doctrine.

This antipolitics tendency has had a wretched effect on our democracy. It has led to a series of overlapping downward spirals:

The antipolitics people elect legislators who have no political skills or experience. That incompetence leads to dysfunctional government, which leads to more disgust with government, which leads to a demand for even more outsiders.

The antipolitics people dont accept that politics is a limited activity. They make soaring promises and raise ridiculous expectations. When those expectations are not met, voters grow cynical and, disgusted, turn even further in the direction of antipolitics.

The antipolitics people refuse compromise and so block the legislative process. The absence of accomplishment destroys public trust. The decline in trust makes deal-making harder.

Were now at a point where the Senate says it wont even hold hearings on a presidential Supreme Court nominee, in clear defiance of custom and the Constitution. Were now at a point in which politicians live in fear if they try to compromise and legislate. Were now at a point in which normal political conversation has broken down. People feel unheard, which makes them shout even louder, which further destroys conversation.

And in walks Donald Trump. People say that Trump is an unconventional candidate and that he represents a break from politics as usual. Thats not true. Trump is the culmination of the trends we have been seeing for the last 30 years: the desire for outsiders; the bashing style of rhetoric that makes conversation impossible; the decline of coherent political parties; the declining importance of policy; the tendency to fight cultural battles and identity wars through political means.

Trump represents the path the founders rejected. There is a hint of violence undergirding his campaign. There is always a whiff, and sometimes more than a whiff, of Id like to punch him in the face.

I printed out a Times list of the insults Trump has hurled on Twitter. The list took up 33 pages. Trumps style is bashing and pummeling. Everyone who opposes or disagrees with him is an idiot, a moron or a loser. The implied promise of his campaign is that he will come to Washington and bully his way through.

Trumps supporters arent looking for a political process to address their needs. They are looking for a superhero. As the political scientist Matthew MacWilliams found, the one trait that best predicts whether youre a Trump supporter is how high you score on tests that measure authoritarianism.

This isnt just an American phenomenon. Politics is in retreat and authoritarianism is on the rise worldwide. The answer to Trump is politics. Its acknowledging other people exist. Its taking pleasure in that difference and hammering out workable arrangements. As Harold Laski put it, We shall make the basis of our state consent to disagreement. Therein shall we ensure its deepest harmony.",R
"Donald Trump Is Going To Be Elected
","Donald Trump is going to be elected president.

The American people voted for him a long time ago.

They voted for him when The History Channel went from showing documentaries about the Second World War to Pawn Stars and Swamp People.

They voted for him when The Discovery Channel went from showing Lost Treasures of the Yangtze Valley to Naked and Afraid.

They voted for him when The Learning Channel moved from something you could learn from to My 600-lb Life.

They voted for him when CBS went from airing Harvest of Shame to airing Big Brother.

These networks didnt make these programming changes by accident. They were responding to what the American people actually wanted. And what they wanted was Naked and Afraid and Duck Dynasty.

The polls may show that Donald Trump is losing to Hillary Clinton, but dont you believe those polls. When the AC Nielsen Company selects a new Nielsen family, they disregard the new familys results for the first three months. The reason: when they feel they are being monitored, people lie about what they are watching. In the first three months, knowing they are being watched, they will tune into PBS. But over time they get tired of pretending. Then it is back to the Kardashians.

The same goes for people who are being asked by pollsters for whom they are voting. They will not say Donald Trump. It is too embarrassing. But the truth is, they like Trump. He is just like their favorite shows on TV.

Mindless entertainment.

Trumps replacement of Paul Manafort with Breitbarts Steve Bannon shows that Trump understands how Americans actually think. They think TV. They think ratings. They think entertainment.

We are a TV-based culture. We have been for some time now. The average American spends 5 hours a day, every day, watching TV. After sleep, it is our number one activity.

More shockingly, we spend 8.5 hours a day staring at screens  phones, tablets, computers. And more and more of the content on those devices is also video and TV.

If you spend 5-8 hours a day, every day, for years and years doing the same thing it has an impact on you. For the past 40 years, we have devoted 5-8 hours a day staring at a screen  every day. And we havent been watching Judy Woodruff. We have been watching reality TV shows. That is what we love. That is what we resonate to. The Real Housewives of Atlanta.

The French may love food. The Italians may love opera. What we love is TV. We are TV culture. It defines who we are.

In the 1950s, early television was allowed, with many restrictions, to be an observational guest at political conventions. They were quiet flies on the wall, carefully and quietly commentating on what they saw way down below. They did not get involved in the process. Today, they ARE the process. Today, political conventions are nothing but carefully directed TV shows. Likewise debates. They exist only to entertain a TV audience. TV and entertainment now dictate everything political. It is a never-ending show. The biggest reality show on air.

And Donald Trump is great TV.

He knows how to entertain.

He understands ratings.

Hillary Clinton is crap TV.

She may be smarter, better prepared, a better politician. It wont matter. She is terrible entertainment.

Thats just how it is. Depressing, but true.

He is Kim Kardashian. She is Judy Woodruff.

Who gets better ratings?

Who would you rather watch for the next four years?

Honestly...

In 1825, the great French gastronom Brillat de Savarind said, Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are. Today, in America, we can safely say, Tell me what you watch, and I will tell you what you are.

And what do we watch?

It isnt PBS NewsHour.",R
"Flight logs show Bill Clinton flew on sex offender's jet much more than previously known
","Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenders infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the Lolita Express -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com.

Clintons presence aboard Jeffrey Epsteins Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including Tatiana. The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.

Bill Clinton  associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile, said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called ""TrafficKing."" Why would a former president associate with a man like that?

Virginia Roberts, 32, who claims she was pimped out by Epstein at age 15, has previously claimed she saw Clinton at Epsteins getaway in 2002, but logs do not show Clinton aboard any flights to St. Thomas, the nearest airport capable of accommodating Epstein's plane. They do show Clinton flying aboard Epsteins plane to such destinations as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, the Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa.

Among those regularly traveling with Clinton were Epsteins associates, New York socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and Epsteins assistant, Sarah Kellen, both of whom were investigated by the FBI and Palm Beach Police for recruiting girls for Epstein and his friends.

In response to a separate FOIA request from FoxNews.com, the U.S. Secret Service said it has no records showing agents were ever on the island with Clinton.

A Clinton spokesperson did not return emails requesting comment about the former presidents relationship and travels with Epstein. The Clinton Library said it had no relevant information and does not keep track of Clintons travel records.

Martin Weinberg, Epsteins current attorney, did not respond to multiple inquiries. Epstein said in a court filing said that he and his associates have been the subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions.

Police in Palm Beach, Fla., launched a year-long investigation in 2005 into Epstein after parents of a 14-year-old girl said their daughter was sexually abused by him. Police interviewed dozens of witnesses, confiscated his trash, performed surveillance and searched his Palm Beach mansion, ultimately identifying 20 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 who they said were sexually abused by Epstein.

In 2006, at the request of Palm Beach Police, the FBI launched a federal probe into allegations that Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of 14 and 17 to engage in illegal sexual activities.

According to court documents, police investigators found a clear indication that Epsteins staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of 12 and 16 years old literally every day, often two or three times per day.

One victim, in sworn deposition testimony, said Epstein began sexually assaulting her when she was 13 years old and molested her on more than 50 occasions over the next three years. The girls testified they were lured to Epsteins home after being promised hundreds of dollars to be his model or masseuse, but when they arrived, he ordered them to take off their clothes and massage his naked body while he masturbated and used sex toys on them.

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse, witness tampering and money laundering, but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed up.

On Sept. 24, 2007, in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency, Epstein agreed to a 30-month sentence, including 18 months of jail time and 12 months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse.

In exchange, the U.S. Attorneys Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his co-conspirators.

Florida attorney Brad Edwards, who represented some of Epsteins alleged victims, is suing the federal government over the secret non-prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned. Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims to prevent them from voicing any objection, and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politically-connected billionaire and all of his co-conspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls.

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida did not respond to a request for comment about the deal.

Other politicians, celebrities and businessmen, including presidential candidate Donald Trump, have been accused of fraternizing with Epstein. Trump lawyer Alan Garten told FoxNews.com in a statement Trump and Epstein are not pals.

There was no relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump, he said. They were not friends and they did not socialize together.",R
"Why The New Child Rape Case Filed Against Donald Trump Should Not Be Ignored
","An anonymous Jane Doe filed a federal lawsuit against GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump last week, accusing him of raping her in 1994 when she was thirteen years old. The mainstream media ignored the filing.

If the Bill Cosby case has taught us anything, it is to not disregard rape cases against famous men. Serious journalists have publicly apologized for turning a blind eye to the Cosby accusers for over a decade, notwithstanding the large number of women who had come forward with credible claims. And now history is repeating itself.

In covering a story, a media outlet is not finding guilt. It is simply reporting the news that a lawsuit has been filed against Mr. Trump, and ideally putting the complaint in context. Unproven allegations are just that - unproven, and should be identified that way. (Mr. Trumps lawyer says the charges are categorically untrue, completely fabricated and politically motivated.) Proof comes later, at trial. But the November election will come well before any trial. And while Mr. Trump is presumed innocent, we are permitted  no, we are obligated  to analyze the cases viability now.

No outsider can say whether Mr. Trump is innocent or guilty of these new rape charges. But we can look at his record, analyze the court filings here, and make a determination as to credibility  whether the allegations are believable enough for us to take them seriously and investigate them, keeping in mind his denial and reporting new facts as they develop.

I have done that. And the answer is a clear yes. These allegations are credible. They ought not be ignored. Mainstream media, Im looking at you.

1. Consider the context: Mr. Trumps overt, even proud misogyny.

The rape case must be viewed through the lens of Mr. Trumps current, longstanding and well documented contempt for women. Men who objectify women are more likely to become perpetrators of sexual violence, just as one with a long history of overtly racist comments is more likely to commit a hate crime.

Mr. Trump has relished calling women dogs, slobs and pigs, and cyberstalked and derided journalist Megyn Kelly for having the temerity to ask him to defend his own words. He threw out the most misogynist of attacks, attempting to undermine her professionalism by accusing her of menstruating. Hes cruelly ridiculed the appearance of a female opponent (Carly Fiorina) and an opponents wife (Heidi Cruz). His campaign even openly acknowledged that it disqualified all women for consideration as his vice-president.

Mr. Trump has a long history of debasing women hes worked with, crossing the line on a regular basis. Hes taken lifelong joy in objectifying women, including his proclamation: Women, you have to treat em like shit.

This cannot be ignored. Decades of abusive language does not make him a rapist. But it does show us who the man is: a callous, meanspirited misogynist who no sane person would leave alone with her daughter. As Dr. Maya Angelou said, When someone shows you who they really are, believe them.

2. More context: two prior sexual assault court claims have been made against Mr. Trump.

But Mr. Trump has been accused of worse than just misogynist language. Two prior women have accused Mr. Trump, in court documents, of actual or attempted sexual assault. (Mr. Trump denies all the allegations.)

Under oath, Ivana Trump accused Mr. Trump of a violent rape.

First was Ivana Trump, Donald Trumps first wife, who said under oath in a 1989 deposition that he had violently attacked her, ripped out her hair and forcibly penetrated her without her consent. According to the Daily Beast, she claims he was wildly angry that shed referred him to a cosmetic surgeon who had botched a scalp reduction job (to cover a bald spot) and caused pain in his scalp - hence the vindictive yanking on her hair. At the time Ms. Trump said she felt violated by the alleged rape.

A few years later, after their divorce was settled, Ms. Trump claimed that she did not mean the word rape in a literal or criminal sense.

Note: virtually every settlement of a case involving a high profile person paying money to a former spouse - or anyone - requires the person receiving the money to agree in writing to ironclad nondisparagement and confidentiality. In plain English: you promise to be quiet and not say anything bad about the party paying you money. This has been the case in hundreds of settlement agreements I have worked on over the years. Ms. Trump was almost certainly contractually prohibited after she signed from saying anything negative about Mr. Trump. And it is also common to attempt to cure prior negative statements with new agreed-to language - like, I didnt mean it literally. (You didnt mean forcible penetration literally?)

A business acquaintance accused Mr. Trump of sexual harassment and attempted rape.

A second woman accused Donald Trump of sexual assault, in 1997. According to The Guardian, then 34-year-old Jill Harth alleged in a federal lawsuit that Trump violated her physical and mental integrity when he touched her intimately without consent after her husband went into business with him, leaving her emotionally devastated [and] distraught. The lawsuit called the multiple acts attempted rape. Shortly thereafter she voluntarily withdrew the case when a parallel suit against Mr. Trump brought by her husband was settled. When The Guardian reached the woman in 2016 to ask whether she stood by her sexual assault allegations, she responded, yes.

In a court filing, according to a report, Ms. Harth alleged that while she and her husband were trying to do a business deal with Mr. Trump regarding a beauty pageant, he repeatedly propositioned her for sex and groped her, culminating in this frightening alleged incident:

Trump forcefully removed (Harth) from public areas of Mar-A-Lago in Florida and forced (her) into a bedroom belonging to defendants daughter Ivanka, wherein (Trump) forcibly kissed, fondled, and restrained (her) from leaving, against (her) will and despite her protests. In the court document, she said that Trump bragged that he would be the best lover you ever have.

Recently Donald Trump issued a statement that womens claims of sexual harassment, documented in a lengthy New York Times investigation which included Ms. Harths lawsuit, were made up.

Jill Harth responded angrily on Twitter last week: My part was true. I didnt talk. As usual you opened your big mouth. 

In other words, she is standing by her story.

3. The new Jane Doe child rape claim against Mr. Trump is consistent with verifiable facts about Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein, and has a powerful witness statement attached to it.

A third woman accused Mr. Trump of rape very recently. According to the Daily Mail, a woman filed an April 2016 lawsuit claiming that when she was thirteen years old she was held as a sex slave to Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein. The woman claimed to have a witness, Tiffany Doe, to the incidents. She filed the case in pro per, that is, without the assistance of a lawyer.

The case was dismissed by the court for technical filing errors. She then obtained a lawyer and the case was modified and refiled in New York federal court, against Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein.

Ive carefully reviewed this federal complaint. It is now much stronger than the one she filed on her own, which makes sense because she now has an experienced litigator representing her. Jane Doe says that as a 13-year-old, she was enticed to attend parties at the home of Jeffrey Epstein with the promise of money modeling jobs. Mr. Epstein is a notorious billionaire pedophile who is now a Level 3 registered sex offender  the most dangerous kind, a threat to public safety  after being convicted of misconduct with another underage girl.

Jane Doe says that Mr. Trump initiated sexual contact with her on four occasions in 1994. Since she was thirteen at the time, consent is not an issue. If Mr. Trump had any type of sexual contact with her in 1994, it was a crime.

On the fourth incident, she says Mr. Trump tied her to a bed and forcibly raped her, in a savage sexual attack, while she pleaded with him to stop. She says Mr. Trump violently struck her in the face. She says that afterward, if she ever revealed what he had done, Mr. Trump threatened that she and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. She says she has been in fear of him ever since.

New Yorks five year statute of limitations on this claim  the legal deadline for filing  has long since run. However, Jane Does attorney, Thomas Meagher, argues in his court filing that because she was threatened by Mr. Trump, she has been under duress all this time, and therefore she should be permitted additional time to come forward. Legally, this is calling tolling  stopping the clock, allowing more time to file the case. As a result, the complaint alleges, Jane Doe did not have freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time. He cites two New York cases which I have read and which do support tolling

Two unusual documents are attached to Jane Does complaints  sworn declarations attesting to the facts. The first is from Jane Doe herself, telling her horrific story, including the allegation that Jeffrey Epstein also raped her and threatened her into silence, and this stunner:

Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump . . .

And this one:

Defendant Trump stated that I shouldnt ever say anything if I didnt want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed.

The second declaration is even more astonishing, because it is signed by Tiffany Doe, Mr. Epsteins party planner from 1991-2000. Tiffany Doe says that her duties were to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties. (Adolescents are, legally, children.

Tiffany Doe says that she recruited Jane Doe at the Port Authority in New York, persuaded her to attend Mr. Epsteins parties, and actually witnessed the sexual assaults on Jane Doe:

I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old.

It is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness. But Tiffany Doe says:

I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop.

Tiffany Doe corroborates, based on her own personal observations, just about everything in Jane Does complaint: that 12-year-old Maria was involved in a sex act with Mr. Trump, that Mr. Trump threatened the life of Jane Doe if she ever revealed what happened, and that she would disappear like Maria if she did.

Tiffany Doe herself says that she is in mortal fear of Mr. Trump to this day:
I am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein . . . I swear to these facts under the penalty for perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger.

Given all this, and based on the record thus far, Jane Does claims appear credible. Mr. Epsteins own sexual crimes and parties with underage girls are well documented, as is Mr. Trumps relationship with him two decades ago in New York City. Mr. Trump told a reporter a few years ago: Ive known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. Hes a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life.

Powerfully, Jane Doe appears to have an eyewitness to all aspects of her claim, a witness who appears to have put herself in substantial danger by coming forward, because at a minimum Mr. Epstein knows her true identity.

Jane Doe has not granted any interviews, and we dont know anything about her background, or Tiffany Does, or the details of their stories. Much information needs to be revealed to fully assess this case. Perhaps they will be discredited on cross-examination. Perhaps they will recant. But if were going to speculate in that direction, we should speculate in the other direction as well. Perhaps Jane Doe and her lawyer will have more evidence and witnesses to corroborate her claim. Perhaps witnesses from Mr. Epsteins notorious parties will come forward. We just cant know any of that at this point.

But based on what we do know now, Jane Does claims fall squarely into the long, ugly context of Mr. Trumps life of misogyny, are consistent with prior sexual misconduct claims, are backed up by an eyewitness, and thus should be taken seriously. Her claims merit sober consideration and investigation.

We live in a world where wealthy, powerful men often use and abuse women and girls. While these allegations may shock some, as a lawyer who represents women in sexual abuse cases every day, I can tell you that sadly, they are common, as is an accusers desire to remain anonymous, and her terror in coming forward.

What do you call a nation that refuses to even look at sexual assault claims against a man seeking to lead the free world?

"Donald Trump Hired Me As An Attorney. Please Don’t Support Him For President.
","Don't expect to see Donald Trump give a humble concession speech if he loses the Republican presidential nomination.

During a Sunday rally in Maryland, the Republican presidential frontrunner mocked candidates who praise their opponents during concession speeches, saying that if he loses the contest, Americans will probably not hear much from him again.

""They fight like hell for six months, and they're saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine,"" Trump said. ""And then one of them loses, one of them wins. And the one who loses says, 'I just want to congratulate my opponent. He is a brilliant man, he'll be a great governor or president or whatever.'""

He continued: ""I'm not sure you're ever going to see me there. I don't think I'm going to lose, but if I do, I don't think you're ever going to see me again, folks. I think I'll go to Turnberry and play golf or something.""

Trump's mockery wasn't relegated just to the electoral losers. He also said Sunday that the winners were too modest.

""Half the times [the winners] put them in the administration  that's how they get rid of them,"" Trump said of the losing candidates.

This line of thought has not stopped Trump from graciously accepting endorsements from other candidates who have dropped out of the presidential race. Trump frequently touts his support from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

During a news conference in February announcing Christie's endorsement, Trump lauded Christie's tenure as a governor and his barbs during the Republican presidential debates.

""Generally speaking, I'm not big on endorsements,"" Trump said, adding, ""This was an endorsement that really meant a lot.""",R
"This simple calculator tells you how each presidential candidate's tax plan affects you
","The presidential candidates have wildly varying tax proposals.

Donald Trump and Ted Cruz propose massive cuts that would greatly reduce federal income taxes on everyone, especially the wealthy, while cutting a wide host of government programs. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders proposes virtually the opposite: tax increases on everyone, with hikes on the wealthy especially, while adding comprehensive government programs. And Hillary Clinton proposes much smaller tax increases, all focused on the rich.

But what do their plans mean for your federal tax liability?

We partnered with the Tax Policy Center to create a calculator that will estimate how each presidential candidate's tax plan would affect you  or, more accurately, people like you. For example, if you are part of a couple with two children earning $38,000 a year, this calculator tells you the average change in federal taxes for all couples with two children who earn between $35,000 and $40,000 a year.

Before you change your vacation plans based on these numbers, keep in mind they are only estimates. Every taxpayer has a slightly different situation  someone might be deducting business expenses, for example, while another person will be paying a tax for not carrying insurance coverage. This creates millions of different scenarios.

Accounting for all of that is prohibitively complicated and time-consuming. But what we have done is simplify the process to consider only the biggest factors (income, marital status, and children) and only look at the four taxes with the largest impact (individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and excise taxes).

Try it yourself below.

(Note: The Tax Policy Center did not perform an analysis of John Kasich's tax plan because his plan lacks sufficient detail to model. They have reached out to the Kasich campaign in search of more details, and will analyze the plan if they receive enough information to do so.)

The calculator: How much does each candidate's tax plan affect you?

Read this: Ezra wrote a piece about what the tax calculator tells us about the candidates. On Cruz and Trump, he writes:

In a sense, both GOP candidates are gaming the calculator: They've proposed tremendous cuts, but without knowing who will pay for those cuts, it's hard to know who will truly be helped and who will be badly hurt.
On Sanders, he writes:

Sanders, meanwhile, proposes to raise taxes by more than Trump proposes to cut them. But it's wrong, I think, to view Sanders's plan as primarily a change to America's tax code. The huge tax increases are a byproduct of Sanders's plans to nationalize major sectors of American life.
Read the full analysis here.

Update on why rates are higher than you think: We've been getting a lot of questions about why your current effective tax rate is so high. Here's a note from Tax Policy Center director Len Burman that explains why this is happening:

You might be surprised at how much taxes youre paying under current law. Were including payroll taxes, excise taxes, and corporate income taxes as well as individual income taxes. Most working people actually pay more in payroll tax than income tax. And they pay much more if you include the employers portion of the tax. Most economists think employers pass their share of the tax on to workers in the form of lower wages.
Update, plus a FAQ section: To calculate the tax rate, we originally used adjusted gross income (AGI), but we decided to switch over to expanded cash income (ECI), because this measure includes income that is not subject to income tax, like health insurance premiums paid by employers. This allows the calculator to provide a more accurate view of your tax rate. For a longer explanation, read this Q&A.

What we learned from our calculator
Play around with different incomes other than your own to get a better idea of how each candidate deals with the poor, middle class, and wealthy.

In short, what you'll see is:

Clinton proposes keeping things mostly the same.
Sanders wants to implement massive increases across the board, including on the poor.
Cruz and Trump propose big cuts for everyone  but the wealthier you are, the more you keep in your pocket.
But how does this affect how much money the federal government brings in?
It's one thing to know how your taxes will change, but you can't view it in a vacuum. What the federal government does can affect your bottom line, too.

For example, Bernie Sanders's plan would raise taxes on everyone, but it would also pay for health care, education, and other programs that you would no longer have to pay for. And it goes the other way, too. If Donald Trump's tax plan was implemented, everyone would get a tax cut, but it also means government services would be cut, so you would have to pay for them yourself.

So this is how each candidate deals with this balance:

Donald Trump: His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated $9.5 trillion over the next decade. Cuts would be across the board, but most cuts would be for wealthier households. His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending, which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government. (Here are more details on Trump's plan.)

Ted Cruz: His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated $8.6 trillion over the next decade. Much like Trump's plan, cuts would be across the board, but most cuts are for wealthier households. His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending, which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government. (Here are more details on Cruz's plan.)

Hillary Clinton: Her plan would raise federal revenues by an additional $1.1 trillion over the next decade. Most increases would be for wealthier households, while lower-income households aren't affected much. The additional revenues will pay for programs that benefit many Americans. (Here are more details on Clinton's plan.)

Bernie Sanders: His plan would raise federal revenues by an estimated $15.3 trillion over the next decade. He would raise taxes for almost all households, but most increases would be for wealthier households; tax increases would be small for lower- and middle-income households. Additional revenues would pay for health care, education, and other programs, so households would pay less than what they currently pay for those services. (Here are more details on Sanders's plan.)",R
"Donald Trump's campaign manager says rape would not exist if women were stronger
","Donald Trumps new campaign manager once insisted that rape could be eradicated if women were as strong as men.

Kellyanne Conway was discussing the roles of women in the military on a 2013 episode of PBS To the Contrary, a roundtable discussion show featuring an all-women panel, when she made the baffling, victim-blaming declaration.

If we were physiologically  not mentally, emotionally, professionally  equal to men, if we were physiologically as strong as men, rape would not exist, she said. You would be able to defend yourself and fight him off.

Without any prompting from the other women pundits, Conway brought up her point on rape.

"Pantsuit Power flashmob video for Hillary Clinton Two women 170 dancers and no police
","It came together in about a week. First, the idea for a punchy, uplifting dance video that would tell a story about diversity, difference and communal support. Then, 170 dancers, a few hours of rehearsalsand pantsuits. Lots of pantsuits.

The result: the #Pantsuitpower Flashmob for Hillary dance video, performed at New Yorks Union Square. Its gotten nearly 2 million views on Facebook in a matter of days.



The video, accompanied by Justin Timberlakes contagiously boppy disco-pop song Cant Stop the Feeling, was posted on Facebook and Vimeo this week by Humanity for Hillary, a social media campaign aimed at artists, in support of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

I wanted to bring some kind of humanity to her campaign, because I think humanity and love and humor tend to get lost when were in the heat of all of this, says Celia Rowlson-Hall, 32, a New York-based choreographer whos worked on HBOs Girls and other TV shows and music videos. She and her Washington, D.C.-based friend, hiphop choreographer Crishon Landers, created the pantsuit dance, and Rowlson-Hall directed the video with her partner, Mia Lidofsky, an independent film producer. The couple met on the set of Girls.

We just felt the need to do something, Rowlson-Hall says. We thought, how can we creatively impact this election? So we made the video.

Theres nothing like dance to convey enthusiasm and energy, so its a natural political tool. The fact that its rarely used to rally votersand even more rarely used so wellis what makes this video feel so fresh. That, and the clarity of the choreography, the invigorating spirit and skill of the videos massive chorus line, and the catchy tune.

[In a departure from negative TV ads, Clinton airs a spot featuring home videos of children.]

A graduate of North Carolina School of the Arts, Rowlson-Hall has worked in the New York dance scene for the past decade, first performing with a couple of troupes, and more recently choreographing for stage, film and television. She made her feature-film directorial debut with Ma, writing the wordless script, choreographing it and starring in it; it became a favorite of the 2015 American Film Institute Festival. She and Landers choreographed the flashmob scene in about four hours, she says, using simple, clear moves drawn from hiphop, ballet and modern dance. Each bears a message: Raised fists signify #BlackLivesMatter, arms and faces tilted to the sky hint at solar energy, circling hips symbolize reproductive rights. In the quietest and most emotional moment, dancers take a knee to evoke San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernicks national anthem protest against police brutality. Others stand with a hand on their hearts.

This is our right as a democracy to protest or honor the flag as we see fit, says Rowlson-Hall. 

She put the word out on Instagram and Facebook seeking dancers. She videotaped herself dancing the steps, and texted it to the dancers whod replied. Many are professionals. A few came from Broadways Fiddler on the Roof and the Martha Graham Dance Company. Some came from as far away as Toronto. Assorted dance enthusiasts joined indentists, other artists and little girls fresh from soccer practice. They had a couple days to learn the moves on their own, then they met in small groups for one-hour sessions with the choreographers. Thats when they were also fitted for their pantsuits, an homage to Clintons go-to workwear. A few suits were donated by Topshop. Stylists scoured thrift stores for the rest.

[The funniest lines from Hillary Clintons interview on Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis]

Near the end you can glimpse the slender, short-haired Rowlson-Hall grooving in a pinstriped suit, her T-shirt emblazoned with The Future is Female.

For all the ebullient energy of the dancing, the video also produced some headaches. The directors didnt have a permit to use Union Square for their shoot.

We were terrified wed get shut down by the cops, says Lidofsky. They also feared pushback from Timberlake. They reached out to his manager about using his song, Lidofsky adds, but with no reply they plowed ahead, hoping Timberlake wouldnt mind. (No word from him yet.)

The only time the whole group rehearsed together was 20 minutes before the taping last Sunday morning, Oct 2.

The dancers came knowing the choreography to a T. Ive never seen dancers work like that, says Rowlson-Hall. It was a whirlwind.

Clinton has some appreciation for dance: Her daughter, Chelsea, was a Washington School of Ballet student during Bill Clintons presidency. So far, however, Hillary Clinton has been silent about the pantsuit dance.

But were refreshing our email every single minute, Lidofsky says with a laugh. We really hope she saw this, and felt the love.",R
"He fought in World War II. He died in 2014. And he just registered to vote in Va.
","RICHMOND  The FBI and local police are investigating how at least 19 dead Virginians were recently re-registered to vote in this critical swing state.

One case came to light after relatives of a deceased man received a note congratulating him for registering, Rockingham County Commonwealths Attorney Marsha Garst said Thursday.

His family members were very distraught, said Garst, who confirmed the existence of the FBI and police investigation but said she could provide few details because the case is ongoing.

All 19 were initially registered as voters in the Shenandoah Valley city of Harrisonburg, although a clerk double-checking the entries later raised questions about one. She recognized the name of Richard Allen Claybrook Sr., who died in 2014 at age 87, because his son is a well-known local judge. She happened to recall that the judges father had died.

He was a retired Fairfax County elementary school principal and had fought in World War II, said his son, retired Harrisonburg General District Court Judge Richard Allen Claybrook Jr. So our family is very disgusted that they would pick his name, because he was such a law-abiding citizen devoted to public service.

[Amid voter ID fight and misleading mailings, voting to begin in battleground Va.]

All of the forms had been submitted by a private group that was working to register voters on the campus of James Madison University, according to the Harrisonburg registrars office. The group was not identified. No charges have been filed.

Republicans in the state House of Delegates, who in recent years have supported tighter voter ID laws, held a conference call with reporters to call attention to the investigation.

Oftentimes we hear our Democratic colleagues suggest that voter fraud doesnt exist in Virginia, or its a myth, House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said. This is proof that voter fraud not only exists but is ongoing and is a threat to the integrity of our elections.

House Minority Leader David J. Toscano (D-Charlottesville) said the case was not proof of voter fraud because no one had actually managed to cast a vote in the names of the dead.

First of all, there was no voter fraud  they caught him, Toscano said. Nobody cast a vote. .?.?. Theres still no evidence of that going on in the state. But there is evidence every time you turn around that the Republicans are trying to make it more difficult for citizens to vote in elections.",R
"Max Lucado My prediction for November 9
","We are really ready for this presidential election to be over. Were ready for an end to the rancor and tackiness.

Voters on both sides feel frustrated, even embarrassed by it all. There is a visceral fear, an angst about the result. What if so and so wins? When we wake up to November 9, post-election, when the confetti is swept away and the election is finally over, what will we see?

I have a prediction. I know exactly what November 9 will bring. Another day of Gods perfect sovereignty.

He will still be in charge. His throne will still be occupied. He will still manage the affairs of the world. Never before has His providence depended on a king, president, or ruler. And it wont on November 9, 2016. The LORD can control a kings mind as he controls a river; he can direct it as he pleases (Proverbs 21:1 NCV).

On one occasion the Lord turned the heart of the King of Assyria so that he aided them in the construction of the Temple.  On another occasion, he stirred the heart of Cyrus to release the Jews to return to Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar was considered to be the mightiest king of his generation. But God humbled and put him in detention for seven years.  The kingdom is the Lords, and He rules over the nations (Psalms 22:28).

Understanding Gods sovereignty over the nations opens the door to peace. When we realize that God influences the hearts of all rulers, we can then choose to pray for them rather than fret about them. Rather than wring our hands we bend our knees, we select prayer over despair.             

Jeremiah did this. He was the prophet to Israel during one of her darkest periods of rebellion. He was called the weeping prophet because he was one. He wept at the condition of the people and the depravity of their faith. He was so distraught that one of his books was entitled Lamentations. But then he considered the work of God. Note the intentionality of his words:

This I recall to my mind,

Therefore I have hope.

The LORDs lovingkindnesses indeed never cease,

For His compassions never fail.

They are new every morning;

Great is Your faithfulness.

(Lam. 3:21-23)

Imitate Jeremiah. Lift up your eyes. Dare to believe that good things will happen. Dare to believe that God was speaking to us when he said: In everything God works for the good of those who love him (Romans 8:28).

Many years ago, I spent a week visiting the interior of Brazil with a long-time missionary pilot. He flew a circuit of remote towns in a small plane that threatened to come undone at the slightest gust of wind. Wilbur and Orville had a sturdier aircraft.

I could not get comfortable. I kept thinking that the plane was going to crash in some Brazilian jungle and Id be gobbled up by piranhas or swallowed by an anaconda.

I kept shifting around, looking down, and gripping my seat. (As if that would help.) Finally, the pilot had had enough of my squirming. He looked at me and shouted over the airplane noise. We wont face anything I cant handle. You might as well trust me to fly the plane.

Is God saying the same to you? If so, make this your prayer:

Dear Lord,

You are perfect. You could not be better than you are.

You are self-created. You exist because you choose to exist.

You are self-sustaining. No one helps you. No one gives you strength.

You are self-governing. Who can question your deeds? Who dares advise you?

You are correct. In every way. In every choice. You regret no decision.

You have never failed. Never! You cannot fail! You are God! You will accomplish your plan.

You are happy. Eternally joyful. Endlessly content.

You are the king, supreme ruler, absolute monarch, overlord, and rajah of all history.

An arch of your eyebrow and a million angels will pivot and salute. Every throne is a footstool to yours. Every crown is papiermch to yours. No limitations, hesitations, questions, second thoughts, or backward glances. You consult no clock. You keep no calendar. You report to no one. You are in charge.

And I trust you.

Circle November 9 on your calendar and write upon it the words: Our good God rules the world.",R
"Aziz Ansari Why Trump Makes Me Scared for My Family
","DONT go anywhere near a mosque, I told my mother. Do all your prayer at home. O.K.?

Were not going, she replied.

I am the son of Muslim immigrants. As I sent that text, in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Orlando, Fla., I realized how awful it was to tell an American citizen to be careful about how she worshiped.

Being Muslim American already carries a decent amount of baggage. In our culture, when people think Muslim, the picture in their heads is not usually of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or the kid who left the boy band One Direction. Its of a scary terrorist character from Homeland or some monster from the news.

Today, with the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels. Its visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense.

Aziz Ansaris parents, Fatima and Shoukath Ansari Credit Photo courtesy Aziz Ansari
There are approximately 3.3 million Muslim Americans. After the attack in Orlando, The Times reported that the F.B.I. is investigating 1,000 potential homegrown violent extremists, a majority of whom are most likely connected in some way to the Islamic State. If everyone on that list is Muslim American, that is 0.03 percent of the Muslim American population. If you round that number, it is 0 percent. The overwhelming number of Muslim Americans have as much in common with that monster in Orlando as any white person has with any of the white terrorists who shoot up movie theaters or schools or abortion clinics.

I asked a young friend of mine, a woman in her 20s of Muslim heritage, how she had been feeling after the attack. I just feel really bad, like people think I have more in common with that idiot psychopath than I do the innocent people being killed, she said. Im really sick of having to explain that Im not a terrorist every time the shooter is brown.

I myself am not a religious person, but after these attacks, anyone that even looks like they might be Muslim understands the feelings my friend described. There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else.

I understand that as far as these problems go, I have it better than most because of my recognizability as an actor. When someone on the street gives me a strange look, its usually because they want to take a selfie with me, not that they think Im a terrorist.

But I remember how those encounters can feel. A few months after the attacks of Sept. 11, I remember walking home from class near N.Y.U., where I was a student. I was crossing the street and a man swore at me from his car window and yelled: Terrorist! To be fair, I may have been too quick to cross the street as the light changed, but Im not sure that warranted being compared to the perpetrators of one of the most awful incidents in human history.

The vitriolic and hate-filled rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump isnt so far off from cursing at strangers from a car window. He has said that people in the American Muslim community know who the bad ones are, implying that millions of innocent people are somehow complicit in awful attacks. Not only is this wrongheaded; but it also does nothing to address the real problems posed by terrorist attacks. By Mr. Trumps logic, after the huge financial crisis of 2007-08, the best way to protect the American economy would have been to ban white males.

According to reporting by Mother Jones, since 9/11, there have been 49 mass shootings in this country, and more than half of those were perpetrated by white males. I doubt well hear Mr. Trump make a speech asking his fellow white males to tell authorities who the bad ones are, or call for restricting white males freedoms.

One way to decrease the risk of terrorism is clear: Keep military-grade weaponry out of the hands of mentally unstable people, those with a history of violence, and those on F.B.I. watch lists. But, despite sit-ins and filibusters, our lawmakers are failing us on this front and choose instead to side with the National Rifle Association. Suspected terrorists can buy assault rifles, but were still carrying tiny bottles of shampoo to the airport. If were going to use the theyll just find another way argument, lets use that to let us keep our shoes on.

Xenophobic rhetoric was central to Mr. Trumps campaign long before the attack in Orlando. This is a guy who kicked off his presidential run by calling Mexicans rapists who were bringing drugs to this country. Numerous times, he has said that Muslims in New Jersey were cheering in the streets on Sept. 11, 2001. This has been continually disproved, but he stands by it. I dont know what every Muslim American was doing that day, but I can tell you what my family was doing. I was studying at N.Y.U., and I lived near the World Trade Center. When the second plane hit, I was on the phone with my mother, who called to tell me to leave my dorm building.

The haunting sound of the second plane hitting the towers is forever ingrained in my head. My building was close enough that it shook upon impact. I was scared for my life as my fellow students and I trekked the panicked streets of Manhattan. My family, unable to reach me on my cellphone, was terrified about my safety as they watched the towers collapse. There was absolutely no cheering. Only sadness, horror and fear.

Mr. Trump, in response to the attack in Orlando, began a tweet with these words: Appreciate the congrats. It appears that day he was the one who was celebrating after an attack.

"Last Night Donald Trump Disqualified Himself
","As a retired military officer, I watched last nights Republican debate from Detroit (transcript here) with a special focus on which candidate is qualified to lead the military as commander-in-chief.  I knew, of course, that Donald Trump had promised in the past to use torture against Americas enemies (last night, he called them animals), that he would pursue and kill not only terrorists but their families (apparently because the families always know, according to Trump, what their father/brother/sister is up to, as if there are no secrets in families).  Trump, in short, is an Old Testament eye for an eye man: if they behead us, well torture and kill them, end of story.

But Trump was put on the spot when he was asked what he would do if the U.S. military failed to carry out his unlawful orders. Instead of saying he wouldnt issue unlawful orders, that he would support and defend the U.S. Constitution, which as president would be his sworn duty to uphold, Trump boasted that the military would follow his orders no matter what.

America: those are the words of a dictator.

Heres what was said:

BAIER: Mr. Trump, just yesterday, almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you, saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable. General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because theyve been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders.

So what would you do, as commander-in-chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?

TRUMP: They wont refuse. Theyre not going to refuse me. Believe me.

BAIER: But theyre illegal.

TRUMP: Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East. Theyre chopping off heads. Theyre chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. Theyre drowning people in steel cages. And he  now were talking about waterboarding.

This really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last  two debates ago about waterboarding. And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you. They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding? I said its fine. And if we want to go stronger, Id go stronger, too, because, frankly...

(APPLAUSE)

... thats the way I feel. Can you imagine  can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that were having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. Thats my opinion.

BAIER: But targeting terrorists families?

(APPLAUSE)

TRUMP: And  and  and  Im a leader. Im a leader. Ive always been a leader. Ive never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, theyre going to do it. Thats what leadership is all about.

Our military does not follow blindly orders issued by The Leader. Our military swears an oath to the Constitution.  We swear to uphold the law of the land.  We dont swear allegiance to a single man (or woman) as president.

Trumps performance last night reminded me of Richard Nixons infamous answer to David Frost about Watergate: When the president does it, that means its not illegal. No, no, a thousand times no.  The president has to obey the law of the land, just as everyone else has to.  No person is above the law, an American ideal that Trump seems neither to understand nor to embrace.

And that disqualifies him to be president and commander-in-chief.",R
"The rise of Donald Trump is a terrifying moment in American politics
","On Monday, Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he merrily repeated a woman in the crowd who called Ted Cruz a pussy. Twenty-four hours later, Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide.

I'm not here to clutch my pearls over Trump's vulgarity; what was telling, rather, was the immaturity of the moment, the glee Trump took in his ""she said it, I didn't"" game. The media, which has grown used to covering Trump as a sideshow, delighted in the moment along with him  it was funny, and it meant clicks, takes, traffic. But it was more than that. It was the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president showing off the demagogue's instinct for amplifying the angriest voice in the mob.

It is undeniably enjoyable to watch Trump. He's red-faced, discursive, funny, angry, strange, unpredictable, and real. He speaks without filter and tweets with reckless abandon. The Donald Trump phenomenon is a riotous union of candidate ego and voter id. America's most skilled political entertainer is putting on the greatest show we've ever seen.

It's so fun to watch that it's easy to lose sight of how terrifying it really is.

Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory. He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament; he's a racist, a sexist, and a demagogue, but he's also a narcissist, a bully, and a dilettante. He lies so constantly and so fluently that it's hard to know if he even realizes he's lying. He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash.

Donald Trump Campaigns Across New Hampshire Ahead Of Primary Day

Trump is in serious contention to win the Republican presidential nomination. His triumph in a general election is unlikely, but it is far from impossible. He's not a joke and he's not a clown. He's a man who could soon be making decisions of war and peace, who would decide which regulations are enforced and which are lifted, who would be responsible for nominating Supreme Court justices and representing America in the community of nations. This is not political entertainment. This is politics.

Trump's path to power has been unnerving. His business is licensing out his own name as a symbol of opulence. He has endured bankruptcies and scandal by bragging his way out of them. He rose to prominence in the Republican Party as a leader of the birther movement. He climbed to the top of the polls in this election by calling Mexicans rapists and killers. He defended a poor debate performance by accusing Megyn Kelly of being on her period. He responded to rival Ted Cruz's surge by calling for a travel ban on Muslims. When two of his supporters attacked a homeless man and said they did it because ""Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,"" he brushed off complaints that he's inspiring violence by saying his supporters are ""very passionate.""

Behind Trump's success is an unerring instinct for harnessing anger, resentment, and fear. His view of the economy is entirely zero-sum  for Americans to win, others must lose. ""We're going to make America great again,"" he said in his New Hampshire victory speech, ""but we're going to do it the old-fashioned way. We're going to beat China, Japan, beat Mexico at trade. We're going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis. It's not going to happen anymore.""

Trump answers America's rage with more rage. As the journalist Molly Ball observed, ""All the other candidates say 'Americans are angry, and I understand.' Trump says, 'IM angry.'"" Trump doesn't offer solutions so much as he offers villains. His message isn't so much that he'll help you as he'll hurt them.

Trump's other gift  the one that gets less attention but is perhaps more important  is his complete lack of shame. It's easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they're exposed as liars, when they're seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested.

Trump doesn't. He has the reality television star's ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won't, to say what others can't, to do what others wouldn't.

Trump lives by the reality television trope that he's not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they're not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. ""I'm not here to make friends"" is another way of saying, ""I'm not bound by the social conventions of normal people."" The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind.

This, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field. He seems more dovish than neoconservatives like Marco Rubio, and less dismissive of the social safety net than libertarians like Rand Paul. But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump; his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do  or what he wouldn't do.

When MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin, who ""kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries,"" Trump replied, ""He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country."" Later, he clarified that he doesn't actually condone killing journalists, but, he warned the crowd, ""I do hate them.""

It's a lie that if you put a frog into a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat the frog will simply boil, but it's a fact that if you put the American political system in a room with Trump for long enough we slowly lose track of how noxious he is, or we at least run out of ways to keep repeating it.

But tonight is a night to repeat it. There is something scary in Donald Trump. We should fear his rise.",R
"This is how fascism comes to America
","The Republican Partys attempt to treat Donald Trump as a normal political candidate would be laughable were it not so perilous to the republic. If only he would mouth the partys conservative principles, all would be well.

But of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or ideology. It has nothing to do with the Republican Party, either, except in its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy. Trump has transcended the party that produced him. His growing army of supporters no longer cares about the party. Because it did not immediately and fully embrace Trump, because a dwindling number of its political and intellectual leaders still resist him, the party is regarded with suspicion and even hostility by his followers. Their allegiance is to him and him alone.

And the source of allegiance? Were supposed to believe that Trumps support stems from economic stagnation or dislocation. Maybe some of it does. But what Trump offers his followers are not economic remedies  his proposals change daily. What he offers is an attitude, an aura of crude strength and machismo, a boasting disrespect for the niceties of the democratic culture that he claims, and his followers believe, has produced national weakness and incompetence. His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common: They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain, intermingled with bits of fear, hatred and anger. His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of others  Muslims, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refugees  whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His program, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up.

That this tough-guy, get-mad-and-get-even approach has gained him an increasingly large and enthusiastic following has probably surprised Trump as much as anyone else. Trump himself is simply and quite literally an egomaniac. But the phenomenon he has created and now leads has become something larger than him, and something far more dangerous.

Republican politicians marvel at how he has tapped into a hitherto unknown swath of the voting public. But what he has tapped into is what the founders most feared when they established the democratic republic: the popular passions unleashed, the mobocracy. Conservatives have been warning for decades about government suffocating liberty. But here is the other threat to liberty that Alexis de Tocqueville and the ancient philosophers warned about: that the people in a democracy, excited, angry and unconstrained, might run roughshod over even the institutions created to preserve their freedoms. As Alexander Hamilton watched the French Revolution unfold, he feared in America what he saw play out in France  that the unleashing of popular passions would lead not to greater democracy but to the arrival of a tyrant, riding to power on the shoulders of the people.

This phenomenon has arisen in other democratic and quasi-democratic countries over the past century, and it has generally been called fascism. Fascist movements, too, had no coherent ideology, no clear set of prescriptions for what ailed society. National socialism was a bundle of contradictions, united chiefly by what, and who, it opposed; fascism in Italy was anti-liberal, anti-democratic, anti-Marxist, anti-capitalist and anti-clerical. Successful fascism was not about policies but about the strongman, the leader (Il Duce, Der Fhrer), in whom could be entrusted the fate of the nation. Whatever the problem, he could fix it. Whatever the threat, internal or external, he could vanquish it, and it was unnecessary for him to explain how. Today, there is Putinism, which also has nothing to do with belief or policy but is about the tough man who single-handedly defends his people against all threats, foreign and domestic.

To understand how such movements take over a democracy, one only has to watch the Republican Party today. These movements play on all the fears, vanities, ambitions and insecurities that make up the human psyche. In democracies, at least for politicians, the only thing that matters is what the voters say they want  vox populi vox Dei. A mass political movement is thus a powerful and, to those who would oppose it, frightening weapon. When controlled and directed by a single leader, it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses. If someone criticizes or opposes the leader, it doesnt matter how popular or admired that person has been. He might be a famous war hero, but if the leader derides and ridicules his heroism, the followers laugh and jeer. He might be the highest-ranking elected guardian of the partys most cherished principles. But if he hesitates to support the leader, he faces political death.

In such an environment, every political figure confronts a stark choice: Get right with the leader and his mass following or get run over. The human race in such circumstances breaks down into predictable categories  and democratic politicians are the most predictable. There are those whose ambition leads them to jump on the bandwagon. They praise the leaders incoherent speeches as the beginning of wisdom, hoping he will reward them with a plum post in the new order. There are those who merely hope to survive. Their consciences wont let them curry favor so shamelessly, so they mumble their pledges of support, like the victims in Stalins show trials, perhaps not realizing that the leader and his followers will get them in the end anyway.

RNC chairman: Republicans will find common ground with Trump  Play Video0:56

A great number will simply kid themselves, refusing to admit that something very different from the usual politics is afoot. Let the storm pass, they insist, and then we can pick up the pieces, rebuild and get back to normal. Meanwhile, dont alienate the leaders mass following. After all, they are voters and will need to be brought back into the fold. As for Trump himself, lets shape him, advise him, steer him in the right direction and, not incidentally, save our political skins.

What these people do not or will not see is that, once in power, Trump will owe them and their party nothing. He will have ridden to power despite the party, catapulted into the White House by a mass following devoted only to him. By then that following will have grown dramatically. Today, less than 5 percent of eligible voters have voted for Trump. But if he wins the election, his legions will likely comprise a majority of the nation. Imagine the power he would wield then. In addition to all that comes from being the leader of a mass following, he would also have the immense powers of the American presidency at his command: the Justice Department, the FBI, the intelligence services, the military. Who would dare to oppose him then? Certainly not a Republican Party that lay down before him even when he was comparatively weak. And is a man like Trump, with infinitely greater power in his hands, likely to become more humble, more judicious, more generous, less vengeful than he is today, than he has been his whole life? Does vast power un-corrupt?

This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes (although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac tapping into popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party  out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear  falling into line behind him.",R
"Trumps history of corruption is mind-boggling. So why is Clinton supposedly the corrupt one
","In the heat of a presidential campaign, youd think that a story about one partys nominee giving a large contribution to a state attorney general who promptly shut down an inquiry into that nominees scam university would be enormous news. But we continue to hear almost nothing about what happened between Donald Trump and Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.

I raised this issue last week, but its worth an update as well as some contextualization. The story re-emerged last week when The Posts David A. Fahrenthold reported that Trump paid a penalty to the IRS after his foundation made an illegal contribution to Bondis PAC. While the Trump organization characterizes that as a bureaucratic oversight, the basic facts are that Bondis office had received multiple complaints from Floridians who said they were cheated by Trump University; while they were looking into it and considering whether to join a lawsuit over Trump University filed by the attorney general of New York State, Bondi called Trump and asked him for a $25,000 donation; shortly after getting the check, Bondis office dropped the inquiry.

At this point we should note that everything here may be completely innocent. Perhaps Bondi didnt realize her office was looking into Trump University. Perhaps the fact that Trumps foundation made the contribution (which, to repeat, is illegal) was just a mix-up. Perhaps when Trump reimbursed the foundation from his personal account, he didnt realize thats not how the law works (the foundation would have to get its money back from Bondis PAC; he could then make a personal donation if he wanted). Perhaps Bondis decision not to pursue the case against Trump was perfectly reasonable. 

But heres the thing: We dont know the answers to those questions, because almost nobody seems to be pursuing them.

For instance, there was only one mention of this story on any of the five Sunday shows, when John Dickerson asked Chris Christie about it on Face the Nation (Christie took great umbrage: I cant believe, John, that anyone would insult Pam Bondi that way). And the comparison with stories about Hillary Clintons emails or the Clinton Foundation is extremely instructive. Whenever we get some new development in any of those Clinton stories, you see blanket coverage  every cable network, every network news program, every newspaper investigates it at length. And even when the new information serves to exonerate Clinton rather than implicate her in wrongdoing, the coverage still emphasizes that the whole thing just raises questions about her integrity.

The big difference is that there are an enormous number of reporters who get assigned to write stories about those issues regarding Clinton. The story of something like the Clinton Foundation gets stretched out over months and months with repeated tellings, always with the insistence that questions are being raised and the implication that shady things are going on, even if there isnt any evidence at a particular moment to support that idea.

When it comes to Trump, on the other hand, weve seen a very different pattern. Heres what happens: A story about some kind of corrupt dealing emerges, usually from the dogged efforts of one or a few journalists; it gets discussed for a couple of days; and then it disappears. Someone might mention it now and again, but the news organizations dont assign a squad of reporters to look into every aspect of it, so no new facts are brought to light and no new stories get written.

The end result of this process is that because of all that repeated examination of Clintons affairs, people become convinced that she must be corrupt to the core. Its not that there isnt plenty of negative coverage of Trump, because of course there is, but its focused mostly on the crazy things he says on any given day.

But the truth is that youd have to work incredibly hard to find a politician who has the kind of history of corruption, double-dealing, and fraud that Donald Trump has. The number of stories which could potentially deserve hundreds and hundreds of articles is absolutely staggering. Heres a partial list:

Trumps casino bankruptcies, which left investors holding the bag while he skedaddled with their money
Trumps habit of refusing to pay contractors who had done work for him, many of whom are struggling small businesses
Trump University, which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation, but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashed.
The Trump Institute, another get-rich-quick scheme in which Trump allowed a couple of grifters to use his name to bilk people out of their money
The Trump Network, a multi-level marketing venture (a.k.a. pyramid scheme) that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitamins
Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally, and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they did
Trumps employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, which involves a claim that he cant find Americans to do the work
Trumps use of hundreds of undocumented workers from Poland in the 1980s, who were paid a pittance for their illegal work
Trumps history of being charged with housing discrimination
Trumps connections to mafia figures involved in New York construction
The time Trump paid the Federal Trade Commission $750,000 over charges that he violated anti-trust laws when trying to take over a rival casino company
The fact that Trump is now being advised by Roger Ailes, who was forced out as Fox News chief when dozens of women came forward to charge him with sexual harassment. According to the allegations, Ailess behavior was positively monstrous; as just one indicator, his abusive and predatory actions toward women were so well-known and so loathsome that in 1968 the morally upstanding folks in the Nixon administration refused to allow him to work there despite his key role in getting Nixon elected.
And that last one is happening right now. To repeat, the point is not that these stories have never been covered, because they have. The point is that they get covered briefly, then everyone in the media moves on. If any of these kinds of stories involved Clinton, news organizations would rush to assign multiple reporters to them, those reporters would start asking questions, and wed learn more about all of them.

Thats important, because we may have reached a point where the frames around the candidates are locked in: Trump is supposedly the crazy/bigoted one, and Clinton is supposedly the corrupt one. Once we decide that those are the appropriate lenses through which the two candidates are to be viewed, it shapes the decisions the media make every day about which stories are important to pursue.

And it means that to a great extent, for all the controversy he has caused and all the unflattering stories in the press about him, Trump is still being let off the hook.",R
"Barbara Bush I don’t know how women can vote for Trump
","Former first lady Barbara Bush said Friday that she doesnt understand how women can vote for Donald Trump after his attacks on Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.
Mrs. Bush sat alongside her son, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, in an interview on CBS This Morning, where the two attacked Mr. Trump as misogynistic and vulgar after he recently used the word s onstage during a campaign rally.
I dont think a president would have ever shouted profanities in a speech in front of thousands of people with kids in the crowd. He does it all the time, said Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida.
Yes, I mean unbelievable, Mrs. Bush responded.
His mother lambasted Mr. Trump for his ongoing attacks Ms. Kelly, including comments widely interpreted as referring to her menstrual cycle, Reuters reported.",R
"I Ran the C.I.A. Now I'm Endorsing Hillary Clinton.
","During a 33-year career at the Central Intelligence Agency, I served presidents of both parties  three Republicans and three Democrats. I was at President George W. Bushs side when we were attacked on Sept. 11; as deputy director of the agency, I was with President Obama when we killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.

I am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican. In my 40 years of voting, I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties. As a government official, I have always been silent about my preference for president.

No longer. On Nov. 8, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president.

Two strongly held beliefs have brought me to this decision. First, Mrs. Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief. I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president  keeping our nation safe. Second, Donald J. Trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security.

I spent four years working with Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state, most often in the White House Situation Room. In these critically important meetings, I found her to be prepared, detail-oriented, thoughtful, inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument.

I also saw the secretarys commitment to our nations security; her belief that America is an exceptional nation that must lead in the world for the country to remain secure and prosperous; her understanding that diplomacy can be effective only if the country is perceived as willing and able to use force if necessary; and, most important, her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all  whether to put young American women and men in harms way.

Mrs. Clinton was an early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice, in opposition to some of her most important colleagues on the National Security Council. During the early debates about how we should respond to the Syrian civil war, she was a strong proponent of a more aggressive approach, one that might have prevented the Islamic State from gaining a foothold in Syria.

I never saw her bring politics into the Situation Room. In fact, I saw the opposite. When some wanted to delay the Bin Laden raid by one day because the White House Correspondents Dinner might be disrupted, she said, Screw the White House Correspondents Dinner.

In sharp contrast to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump has no experience on national security. Even more important, the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief.

These traits include his obvious need for self-aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights, his tendency to make decisions based on intuition, his refusal to change his views based on new information, his routine carelessness with the facts, his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law.

The dangers that flow from Mr. Trumps character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president. It is already damaging our national security.

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer, trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trumps vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated.

Mr. Putin is a great leader, Mr. Trump says, ignoring that he has killed and jailed journalists and political opponents, has invaded two of his neighbors and is driving his economy to ruin. Mr. Trump has also taken policy positions consistent with Russian, not American, interests  endorsing Russian espionage against the United States, supporting Russias annexation of Crimea and giving a green light to a possible Russian invasion of the Baltic States.

In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.

Mr. Trump has also undermined security with his call for barring Muslims from entering the country. This position, which so clearly contradicts the foundational values of our nation, plays into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religions.

In fact, many Muslim Americans play critical roles in protecting our country, including the man, whom I cannot identify, who ran the C.I.A.s Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade and who I believe is most responsible for keeping America safe since the Sept. 11 attacks.

My training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the C.I.A. This is what I am doing now. Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president.",R
"This may shock you Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest
","Its impossible to miss the Hillary for Prison signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. Oh for goodness  that is not going to happen, she said. Im not even going to answer that question.

Based on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.

For decades shes been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as a congenital liar and accused of covering up her husbands misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the Hillary is a liar videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or zone of privacy that she protects too fiercely. Its a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny shes attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.

I would be dead rich, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours Ive spent covering just about every scandal that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor Ive launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. Im not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.

Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.

The yardsticks I use for measuring a politicians honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, Ive looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. Im on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.

The connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up raising serious questions about potential conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.

As for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest pants on fire rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).


I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABCs George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.

The same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?

Colin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvards Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. We expect purity from women candidates, he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, its seen as dishonest, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersings point when he asked Clinton: Have you always told the truth? She gave an honest response, Ive always tried to, always. Always. Pelley said she was leaving wiggle room. What politician wouldnt?

Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons private life. The distrust continues.

These are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesnt have rhino hide, and during her husbands first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.


Like most politicians, shes switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.

Still, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.

Its fair to expect more transparency. But its a double standard to insist on her purity.",R
"Donald Trump 'If I lose I don't think you will ever see me again'
","I like authenticity, especially as compared to survey-tested or heavily spun. I am prepared to let a candidate say something that I dont completely agree with and still support him or her. I think the need to be politically correct has gone too far. I also think the media often hypes and slants stories to the point of being untruthful.

I think a prosperous middle class is the key to the American success story, both economically and politically, and that lobbyists have way too much sway. I am very much a pragmatist, so much so that I like compromise more than I like ideology. I like deals, especially those that are win-win. 

So Donald Trump is my candidate, right? He is NOT!

In 1987, when I was 35 years old and he was 41, Donald Trump hired me to be his attorney on a major northern New Jersey project, a shopping center, which like everything else, was to bear his name, Trump Centre. It was a big deal that he picked me and a high honor for me just a couple of years after I started my law firm, which is now over 30 years old. This was at a time when Trump still built things, having recently finished Trump Tower. 

[Ill never forget when] my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words want me.
He seemed to me smart, business savvy, decisive. He had a very impressive office, a fancy and very big boat, an airline, a helicopter shuttle and several casinos. Within a few years, virtually all of this would be lost because of bad business decisions. Lots of lawyers have worked for Donald Trump; lots and lots. I am no Roy Cohn ? neither as aggressive nor (hopefully) nearly as ethically-challenged ? but I did know well how to get very tough land use matters through an always challenging application process in New Jersey. I was thrilled when he hired me.

After the initial interview, my client contact with Donald was actually not very much. One low point I do remember (actually will never forget) is a limousine ride to a meeting with the editorial board of a New Jersey newspaper in which my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words want me. I was just plain shocked and embarrassed, but I kept smiling. I wanted and needed this client happy. 

While I was working for Donald, various press reports had Trump and his then-wife Ivanna living in a personal apartment in the Trump Tower of 8, 16 and even 20 or 30 rooms. Genuinely curious, I once asked him how many rooms the apartment actually had. I will never forget his response to me: However many they will print.

Donald Trump was then, as he is now, larger than life, particularly in his own eyes, and at the same time frighteningly small, with very little moral grounding. He was then, and still is, all ego and show. 

I once asked him how many rooms [his] apartment actually had. I will never forget his response to me: However many they will print.
I have thought about this a lot, and I want to share my humble insights of why we cannot elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. To me, it is more about character than politics. Because of lack of the former, the latter ? the actual politics of Donald Trump ? are not that easy to discern.

Once I got going with my reasons why Donald would not be good for our country, it was hard to stop. I did stop, however, when I hit 20, about 4,000 words from here. Read on if you are interested.

1. The man lies all the time.

Like the skilled liar he is, he does it with impunity. I watched in Jersey City, NJ when thousands and thousands of people were cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed. The last quarter the gross domestic product was less than zero. The number of illegal immigrants in the United States is 30 million, it could be 34 million.  The Mexican government forces bad people into our country. The unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. 

All these things have been said by Donald, actually often yelled by him, and many times over and over in front of large crowds. How about the whopper, Crime statistics show blacks kill 81 percent of white homicide victims? One has to wonder why this lie would be conceived, much less told. Donald Trump says all of these things forcefully, so they must be true. But they are not! 

Unambiguously, they are what is described as pants on fire untruthful, as in, not a shred of truth. In passing, you have to ponder whether yet another of Donald Trumps oft made statements about the fervor of his Christianity and the Bible being his favorite book are also not grounded in truth. Clearly, thou shall not lie is not his favorite of the Ten Commandments.

2. It is actually not all about the candidate.

Its amazing how often I am right? I alone can fix this. I have a big brain. I advise myself. I am very, very rich. 

Donald really said all these things. His ego seems to know no bounds. When Donald feels insulted by someone, he obsesses without control. He fusses, he fumes, and he says unbelievably inappropriate things. He is in his glory when he can bully his way to a result he covets.

His ego seems to know no bounds. When Donald feels insulted by someone, he obsesses without control.
Did you ever notice that those real people stories other candidates are always telling about someone they just met, struggling with a difficult problem, are just not in the Trump lexicon? He keeps telling us he is all about winners. I guess these folks dont qualify. Said another way, Donald Trump doesnt play well in the sandbox with others.

First, he has his own ideas as to who can be in the sandbox with him. He also wants to run the sandbox. He is the kid who gets his way or stomps off in a huff. What happens when he figures out, even our nations highest office is not all about him? Do we want him with the codes to nuclear weapons?

3. U.S. presidents are by design not kings. 

The Constitution makes them share power. Donald Trump who uses the I word more than anyone who has ever aspired to the job, has a brazenly authoritarian bent. He wants to be a strongman, not a president. 

One has to wonder what would happen if he actually had to govern or make one of his deals in a zero sum world of politics where the other side just says no. What then of his notoriously short attention span, temper or non-stop need to tweet his every frustration?

4. The devil IS in the details.


JONATHAN DRAKE / REUTERS
Donald Trump holds a sign supporting his plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico that he borrowed from a member of the audience at his campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina March 9, 2016.
Winning so much we will get tired of winning, Make good deals with China, or even Make America great again are slogans that dont actually say anything. We are not stupid; share some details with us, so we can figure out whether you know what you are talking about. For Donald, however, in the few instances when specifics do follow, like perhaps the 1,000-mile, 35-55 foot wall or the deportation of 11 million immigrants, the details never come.

Never are we told that to build the wall, even to the lower 35 feet, (by actual construction estimates) would cost $25 billion dollars, even if you could get the land to build it (most of the border Trump wants to wall is in the middle of a river and land in many cases could not even be secured for a fence).

His magic to make Mexico pay for it? The only suggestion I have heard is take it out of remittances from folks mailing money back home or one of his 45 percent tariffs. How is that going to work for the Americans sending the money to relatives or all of us paying 45 percent more for Mexican-made merchandise or the American company doing the manufacturing? How about the fact that the wall would do little to stop illegal immigration, more of which is overstays of visitors than over the border and likely will generate few, if any, jobs for the folks Trump has whipped up into a xenophobic frenzy. 

Then lets take the deportation and just focus on the big stuff. How exactly do you round up and deport 11 million people? Is he going to use stadiums and nationalize cruise ship lines? Who will be doing the rounding up, certainly not the police, the army perhaps? The children left behind? How about the fact that American farms, restaurants, not to mention landscaping and construction labor jobs will go unattended? Vital jobs for sure, but are these the jobs that Trump plans to provide for his real Americans to make America great again?

5. Words matter.

Everything is not a disaster, stupid or a disgrace. Neither is it tremendous, huge, fantastic or amazing. Everyone is not a loser, low energy or a bimbo. Talk of former presidents being liars ? or his favorite, a disaster ? and foreign dictators being great leaders does not advance the discourse. 

Americans are mostly not prudes, but vulgarity from the dais, penis size allusions, reveling in sexual conquests, menstruation-based criticism and crass insults of every shape and form just does not cut it from a president. We have children.


6. Reading is good. So is studying.

Donald Trump recently told us that he does not read much. We know from the recent revelations by Tony Schwartz, his ghost writer on The Art of the Deal (yes, I do have my copy from when it first came out, autographed with Donald telling me to keep up the great work), which Donald says is second only to the Bible as the must-read book, that he certainly has not written a book ? at least not that one.

It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job.
Even though for many years I owned a bookstore and would not let my kids watch TV on weekdays to help them become readers, I do not believe you must read to lead. I do believe, however, that those who seek to lead us need to study hard, seek to gain wisdom from others, and try to master very complex ideas and relationships. I think being president is hard. I am glad that after a long day, President Obama retreats to his private study almost every night for 3 or 4 hours of quiet study... and reading. 

Any fair interpretation of Trumps many bizarre statements and flip-flops makes it clear he has not the slightest inclination to read or study. In his own words, he makes decisions with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I already had, plus the words common sense, because I have lots of common sense and I have a lot of business ability. It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job. 

7. The new vocabulary we are adjusting to is not a good one.

Xenophobe (intense dislike or fear of people from foreign countries); misogynist (strong prejudice against women); nativist (preference for established inhabitants as opposed to immigrants); fascist (authoritarian and dictatorial); bigot (intolerance for those with a different opinion); demagogue (inflaming passions based on popular desires not on rationale arguments); dystopian (describing a place, typically totalitarian, where everything is unpleasant and squalid); racist (oh, you know what this one is). 

We have all had to get the dictionary out to understand many of the not household terms that had to find their way into print to describe the unique phenomenon that is Donald Trump. The scary thing is that these strange words are at least close to the mark. What happened to statesmanlike, well-qualified, or even brilliant, as words we can use to describe people we want to elect to high office? Havent heard any of these associated with the Donald.

8. We need to be careful with tough.


Donald Trump said of a protester at one of his rallies, in the good old days they would have carried him out on a stretcher. His world reveres this brand of toughness. This toughness is not about the strength it takes to use restraint or to make really hard decisions. It is about punching that guy in the face, or at a minimum, saving face ? his. 

I will resist the temptation to belabor the nuclear codes point again, and rather just query do we really want a thin-skinned president who, as he suggested, if a government leader (Castro) was not on the tarmac to meet his plane, would turn around Air Force One and come home. Or one who when confronted with the fact that whether or not his careless re-tweet of a white supremacist-created Jewish star and dollar bill-backed attack of Hillary Clinton was anti-Semitic, cant even just give one of those non-apology-apologies, I am sorry if I offended anyone. A tough-guy who instead declares major newscasters stupid and sick and makes it all about the media who dare to criticize him, with never a word to David Duke and the ugly element high-fiving him and resending his initial offensive post. 

Whether or not the post was intended to even more firmly entrench this segment of support, Trump demonstrates his version of tough, one that glorifies his opinion and his being right over all else. Nowhere in his world can tough be humble, respectful, restrained or diplomatic.

9. Success does matter.

Donald Trumps business success is greatly exaggerated and his skills limited. Donald Trump is a great salesman and a showman/promoter in a league only with PT Barnum. This we can give him. He has also been very good at making his name a brand and selling its use. For a while, he had some pretty high TV ratings by telling out of work celebrities they were fired. However, even in his own playing field, ask any large New York real estate developer, of whichsurprise, surprisehe is not one, at least not as to large (14th in New York City on the latest list), and you will learn his successes are few. 

Four business bankruptcies (1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009), the Plaza Hotel, Trump Air, all three casinos (a couple times) the steaks, the water, Trump Centre in New Jersey that I worked on, Manhattans West Side rail yards (where buildings do bear his name as a consolation), the much-hyped $35,000 get-rich scheme Trump University ? all failures by any measure except of course to Donald, who has no regrets, whatsoever.

Then there are basic business ethics: 3,500 lawsuits, the fact that he has penchant for not paying bills fully or on time, or that he calls himself the King of Debt ? a king made rich by running up debt, then renegotiating it. Is this the skill set we want for the president?

Even with Trumps fabled net worth, always exaggerated by billions more than others calculate, one has to wonder if his true net worth wouldnt be just as much if he took his considerable inheritance from father Fred and just passively invested it. Well never know from Donald ? certainly not from those tax returns he wont release.

10. We could not be the great country we are without the First Amendment, but our media may kill us.

The media is not Donalds enemy as he keeps announcing from the stage. It may be the enemy of the rest of us, however. It sure feels like it lately. The air time Donald gets, and his ability to phone in his rants (especially with the cable media) is nothing short of, to use one of his words, disgusting. 

Donald, who lives by polls and ratings, understands it is ratings and not news worthiness that dictates what is on the airwaves. Donald dominates almost every news cycle, simply by being more outrageous than anyone or anything else. The false equivalency created by point-counterpoint talking heads then makes over-the-top positions seem legitimate. It is reality TV writ large and it is very out of control.

11. Temperament, demeanor and character are important.

In many ways, Donald represents the very worst in all of us, or at least many of us. He is all about continuous gratification. He is the petulant child who wants his way. He is the selfish teenager with no big picture yet. He is the spoiled young man of privilege with the right race and religion, education, good looks, and family fortune to succeed easily, and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not.

He is the spoiled young man of privilege with the right race ... and family fortune to succeed easily and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not.
He is a man who thinks it is okay to call someone fat or ugly or stupid or to make fun of a person with a disability. He is the collector of trophy wives and trophy properties, the guy who wins, or so he thinks, because he has the most toys. 

12. The emperor and his clothes.

Donald says he knows more about the military than anyone else. Why? Because he went to an expensive prep school where they wore uniforms and sometimes marched? How about, I know more about ISIS than the generals. Please, can some real soldiers evaluate this?

Donald says America never wins anymore. Compared to whom, and at what? No doubt we have problems. Democracy is messy. Witness the present campaign, and the long slow recovery from the 2008 recession has not included the middle class nearly enough. And, yes, trade in a world that is now fully connected and integrated is hard to figure out. But by what measure is America, as Donald tells us, a disaster?

How do you actually say and believe, This country is a hell-hole. We are going down fast. Compared to whom? Mexico, China or his most bizarre new favorite, Russia, that he tells us beat us all the time ... because our leaders are stupid? Give us a break. 

13. Sophomoric speech tricks dont work ? at least not with most of us.

Says Donald, I am not going to talk about the libertarian VP candidates alcoholism. I refuse to say... I cannot stand to say... that I cannot stand the sound of Clinton screaming into the microphone all the time. You just did, Donald. We get it that with these statements, even you know you are on shaky ground so you are trying to play it both ways. Doesnt work. Nor does your even more insidious, not-so-clever trick of attributing to others wild accusations that even you are afraid to make, but that you want to advance. 

How about when discussing the Orlando massacre, there are a lot of people that think [President Obama] doesnt want to get it. A lot of people think maybe he doesnt want to know about it I happen to think he just doesnt know what he is doing, but there are many people that think maybe he just doesnt want to get it. He doesnt want to see whats really happening. And that could be. 

Who are these people who have placed the president on the side of the terrorists? Perhaps the same people who, with Trump, saw the masses in New Jersey celebrating the destruction of the twin towers, or those convinced Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster, that Ted Cruzs father was working with Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President Kennedy, or that President Obama was not born in the United States nor did he graduate from Harvard or Columbia. 

Two possibilities. The likely one: lots of people are saying is just Trump code for I want to now float something so outrageous even red-faced Donald cant get it out without this qualifier. Or perhaps the lots of people is a select group, the closed loop of the loyalists who attend his rallies that heard it from him! 

14. A thin skin does not work for a president.

The politicians have again chosen this presidential pigmy as their nominee. So said the long-defunct New York Herald about Abraham Lincoln, now nearly everybodys choice for our nations best president. Consider the statement when George Washington left office: the time is now arrived for the source of all misfortune of our country [to be] reduced to a level with his fellow citizens.

U.S. presidents, all of them, have had their critics, and in our land of wonderful free speech, the critics get to have their say. Thank goodness. That Donald does not do well with criticism is not really open to debate. Ask Megyn Kelly (third-rate talent), Rosie ODonnell (nice little fat Rosie, total loser) or Elizabeth Warren (Pocahontas) or for that matter virtually any of his recently vanquished adversaries: Cruz, Kasich, Rubio or Bush, in just the first tier. Even the one most like him (now apparently looking for a post-New Jersey job with him), Chris Christie felt his sting when he suggested Donald was thin-skinned. He just cant let anything go ever. He obsesses even when he wins. 

Republicans who broke the pledge to support him, they should not be allowed to run for office again. In Donalds world, disagreeing with him has to have a consequence ? a serious one ? and pursuing this goal is worthy of effort and energy, even when it makes no difference. 

Do we really think our president has time for this? Do we really want a man with such sensibilities and such an authoritarian bent in charge of, say, the FBI or the IRS? Does the concept of secret police, a favorite of leaders of this type elsewhere, seem too extreme? Probably, yes. But if I was Donald, I would float it with one of his people are saying declarations. There, I just used his trick. See how easy it is. 

15. Bullies will always exist somewhere, but the White House should not be that somewhere.

What does a bully do? Most of all he or she seeks to intimidate, physically or at least verbally. So far this character trait of Donalds has been exclusively verbal and aimed at business adversaries and more recently politicians and journalists ? and, of course, then ex-ghost writer of his book and ex-employees or contractors he cheated (those who do not have anti-disparagement contractual handcuffs) who dare to candidly assess his conduct. 

What happens when this guy gets the worlds strongest army at his disposal, and a bully pulpit that guarantees him notice? Seem like a bad idea to anyone else?

16. Law and order.

Before it was an Emmy-winning TV show, law and order was a campaign theme used by Richard Nixon in 1968 to get himself elected in a year when our country had two very public assassinations and destructive demonstrations, even riots, in 110 U.S. cities. Nixon sought to mobilize what he called the silent majority around the need for more police. He also tapped into the racial and economic divide between black and white and working class and elite Eastern liberals, and the evil media that his vice president, Spiro Agnew, called nattering nabobs of negativism. Is Donald Trump seeking to bring this back? Of course yes, yet no.

Yes, he wants to separate and mobilize angry voters who feel left behind by an increasingly diverse culture. No, because his dystopian version of lawless, besieged, pitifully weak America is not what Nixon preached, nor for that matter Ronald Reagan. It is unique to him, at least in our country. It is, however, a textbook version of the rallying cry of countless dictators and strongmen. It is a demagogues basic tool, to gin up a problem then declare he is the only one who can fix it. 

As bad as all this rhetoric is, what next? He tells us, On January 20, 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced... crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon?I mean very soon?come to an end. Hows this work, Donald? Martial law? Does he honestly believe President Obama, and for that matter all of his 44 predecessors, would not have liked to have all laws effective and fully followed? If only wishing could make it so! However, since the states, not the federal government, hold sway over most criminal law, the president acting alone has no Constitutional power to do any such thing. What then? More of the water boarding and killing families of terrorists logic? I alone can fix it!

17. Incoherent rants, often contradictory, does not a foreign policy make.

Convince Japan and South Korea to seek nuclear arms. Eliminate NATO. Crush ISIS but do it without Muslim allies and no troops on the ground. Sometimes attack Libya, sometimes not. Sometimes attack surgically, but dont let it come out the way it did. Sometimes its good we attacked Iraq, sometimes not. Do not nation build, but fix Syria. Stop Iran by making better deals. 

In fact, come to think of it, that is the solution to almost everything: just make better deals everywhere. Oh, yes and never apologize for anything. We are America, very, very rich and beholden to no one. Like us or else. Sound like someone we know? 

18. How will anyone effectively be president if we dont at least respect the office?

In the 1960s during an unpopular war, we all endured a president adorning himself with a flag pin and declaring anyone who did not agree with him (which include a heck of a lot of young people on campuses all across America, including me) somehow un-American. Although political opposition is as old as our nation, we begin to slide down the slope of dangerous disrespect when disagreement is replaced with vilification. 

This Republican nominee for the presidency thinks it is okay to accuse a former president of his own party of intentionally going to war on false pretenses and the current President of being in conspiracy with Muslim terrorists. Any thoughtful American of either party or no party, of any political philosophy must see that this must stop. 

Truth, or at least a semblance of some, has to come back. Outrageous lies just have no place in meaningful discourse ? outrageous liars even less so. They cannot become the backbone of a point-counterpoint talking-head media circus that is so much more about ratings than truth.

19. Rich and powerful guys have to play by the rules, too.

Lets not kid ourselves. Trump University was not an academic institution, far from it. It was a get-rich-quick scheme by a guy selling a get-rich-quick scheme. It is not the first or the last of its type. Late night, cheap-advertising-time-television will always feature this fare. Donalds efforts, however, were on so much a grander scale ? $35,000... a university. Really? What this was is an out-and-out fraud scheme by a man now trying to become the leader of our country and the free world. 

We all know, or at least have read, that suckers are born every minute. But cant we at least disrespect those who prey on these poor folks, and when they really go too far, sue them? No, says Donald Trump. The court case brought by a whole class of plaintiffs against his scam is only still in court, Donald says, because the long-time and distinguished federal judge is a hater not capable of giving him justice because his parents are from Mexico.

In Donalds world, the only individual capable of judging him would not be Mexican or related to anyone from Mexico, likewise folks of the Muslim faith, and, oh yeah, likewise women. In this world rich, entitled, egotistical, ethically-challenged older white men should then only be judged by rich, entitled, egotistical, ethically-challenged older white men.

20. We must stand for something.

Donald Trumps version of America does not include folks not like him. Instead, he is all about what Sarah Palin labeled real Americans. The fact that all us others seem to be utterly expendable is deeply troubling. Targeting an entire religion ? Islam, with 1.6 billion adherents, 3.3 million being U.S. citizens ? for extra scrutiny or worse is patently inconsistent with traditional American values, if not those of the real Americans.

It is also unconstitutional, and, beyond all this, incredibly counterproductive as it hardens the lines of controversy by wholesale moving of the allies we need to solve terrorist problems into the enemy camp. Other similar strategies championed by Donald, like waterboarding and other forms of torture, not to mention targeting families of an enemy, are not just illegal. They are, to use another one of his words, stupid. They do not work, very likely making situations worse and our enemies more numerous and passionate.

One has to wonder, what does the America of the real Americans look like? A bunch of intolerant, hyper aggressive, folks behind a big wall, isolated (not trading with anyone and thus with a sick economy and very expensive goods) and with a lot of enemies. No Shining City on the Hill, for sure. Hard to see anything but ruin ahead for such a place.

We can do so much better! For me, better comes easily in the form of former Senator and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. For those who do not come to that conclusion easily (I get it), this year it will have to be the lesser of two evils. No matter what, dont even think about taking us into the abyss that is Donald Trump. ",R
"HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT
","In any normal election year, wed compare the two presidential candidates side by side on the issues. But this is not a normal election year. A comparison like that would be an empty exercise in a race where one candidate  our choice, Hillary Clinton  has a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas, and the other, Donald Trump, discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway. (We will explain in a subsequent editorial why we believe Mr. Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history.)

But this endorsement would also be an empty exercise if it merely affirmed the choice of Clinton supporters. Were aiming instead to persuade those of you who are hesitating to vote for Mrs. Clinton  because you are reluctant to vote for a Democrat, or for another Clinton, or for a candidate who might appear, on the surface, not to offer change from an establishment that seems indifferent and a political system that seems broken.

Running down the other guy wont suffice to make that argument. The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isnt Donald Trump.

The best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs. Clintons capacity to rise to them.

Can Hillary Clinton Keep You Safe? SEPT. 24, 2016
The next president will take office with bigoted, tribalist movements and their leaders on the march. In the Middle East and across Asia, in Russia and Eastern Europe, even in Britain and the United States, war, terrorism and the pressures of globalization are eroding democratic values, fraying alliances and challenging the ideals of tolerance and charity.

The 2016 campaign has brought to the surface the despair and rage of poor and middle-class Americans who say their government has done little to ease the burdens that recession, technological change, foreign competition and war have heaped on their families.

Over 40 years in public life, Hillary Clinton has studied these forces and weighed responses to these problems. Our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect, experience, toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service, often as the first or only woman in the arena.",R
"Dems open convention without Wasserman Schultz
","(CNN)The Democratic National Convention kicked off Monday without its outgoing Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, following a chaotic scene at a morning meeting where she was loudly jeered by Bernie Sanders supporters.

""I have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention,"" Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel newspaper in an interview.
Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who is also the Democratic National Committee's secretary, handled the gaveling instead.
""Delegates, alternatives, standing committee members and all of our honored Democrats and other guests here in Philadelphia and all of you who have joined us by television, radio and online, here in the United States and around the world,"" she said, ""I hereby call the 47th quadrennial Democratic National Convention to order.""
From Russia without love? DNC hack roils Philly
Wasserman Schultz will also not speak tonight or throughout the duration of the convention, a Democrat close to her says. She will remain in Philadelphia until Friday when she formally steps down as leader of the committee.
Wasserman Schultz changed her plans as the fallout deepened from leaked DNC emails that appeared to show the committee favoring presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Sanders during the primary. It became clear Monday that the convention floor could erupt in anger if she gaveled the convention into session or sought to speak.
And the Democratic National Committee issued an apology to Sanders moments after the convention opened, likely hoping to help soothe tensions heading into the week.
""On behalf of everyone at the DNC, we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Sen. Sanders, his supporters, and the entire Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email,"" the statement said. ""These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process. The DNC does not -- and will not -- tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates. Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments, and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again.""
The morning Florida delegate meeting descended into chaos when Wasserman Schultz took the stage, with critics holding up signs with the word ""emails,"" and Sanders supporters booing the congresswoman loudly, even after she began speaking.
""We have to make sure that we move forward together in a unified way,"" Wasserman Schultz said during brief remarks. ""We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive, we know that is not the Florida that we know. The Florida that we know is going to make sure that we continue to make jobs.""
The audience was roughly half supportive of Wasserman Schultz and half detractors, though the angry participants were louder than the other half. Those attendees began to chant, ""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" while Wasserman Schultz was speaking.
Sanders tried to quell some of his dissatisfied supporters at a rally before his expected speech Monday.
""We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine,"" Sanders said, which prompted some attendees to shout him down.

Alternate plans
Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday she is stepping down as chairwoman of the DNC at the end of the party's convention. The drama reinforced concerns about Democratic party unity.
Former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver tried to show a unified Democratic Party on Monday, the morning after Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation.
""This happened, we knew it happened then, now is the time to go forward,' Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" on Monday. ""Now is the time to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump.""
Wasserman Schultz talked with both President Barack Obama and Clinton before making announcing her upcoming resignation, a Democratic source said.
""Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals [which include electing Clinton president] is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention,"" Wasserman Schultz said in the statement.
""As party chair, this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans,"" she said.

DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election. She had been a CNN political commentator, but CNN and Brazile have mutually agreed to suspend their contract, effective immediately, although she will remain on air during the convention week in an unpaid capacity, CNN said. CNN will revisit the contract once Brazile concludes her role.
Separately, a Democratic operative said Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her high command were discussing Housing Secretary Julian Castro as a possible successor to Wasserman Schultz at the DNC helm, among a number of other candidates whose name are being mentioned.
Chants of ""Debbie is done!"" and ""Debbie resigned!"" broke out at a pro-Sanders rally Sunday in Philadelphia after the news was announced.
Party officials decided Saturday that Wasserman Schultz would not have a major speaking role or preside over daily convention proceedings this week. The DNC Rules Committee has named Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, as permanent chair of the convention, according to a DNC source. She will gavel each session to order and will gavel each session closed.
""She's been quarantined,"" another top Democrat said of Wasserman Schultz, following a meeting Saturday night but before her announcement that she was leaving.
Both sides of the aisle react
Obama issued a statement, saying, ""For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful.""
And Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the party.
""I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,"" Clinton said.
After slamming Wasserman Schultz as ""highly overrated,"" Trump, speaking at a rally in Roanoke, Virginia, knocked Clinton for being disloyal to the soon-to-be former DNC chair.
""How about that for disloyalty in terms of Hillary Clinton. Because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton,"" Trump said. ""These politicians. There's no loyalty there. No loyalty. None whatsoever.""
""It gets a little heat and they fire her,"" Trump said. ""Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a bus and it didn't take more than five minutes to make that decision.""
Wasserman's Republican counterpart, Reince Priebus, said, ""I think the day's events show really the uphill climb Democrats face this week.""
""The extreme left will not be satisfied by one person's resignation,"" the Republican party national chairman added.
Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz out the door.
""Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNC's email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign,"" he said in a statement. ""Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz's lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret, classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroad.""
DNC hack: What you need to know
Weaver called Wasserman Schultz's departure a win on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Sunday.
""I think what the signal was today is that the voices of Bernie Sanders supporters have been heard,"" he said. ""And other people, frankly, in the party, Hillary Clinton supporters, who felt this was the last straw, that she had to go, and this shows they have been heard and gives us opportunity to move forward toward November -- united to deal with the problem of Donald Trump.""
Wasserman Schultz's stewardship of the DNC has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process, but her removal from the convention stage comes following the release of nearly 20,000 emails.
One email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Sanders' faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters. Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreement.

Before the announcement, Sanders on Sunday told Tapper the release of the DNC emails that show its staffers working against him underscores the position he's held for months: Wasserman Schultz needs to go.
""I don't think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC, not only for these awful emails, which revealed the prejudice of the DNC, but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people, and I don't think her leadership style is doing that,"" Sanders told Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
""I am not an atheist,"" he said. ""But aside from all of that, it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates -- to be fair and even-minded.""
He added: ""But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.""",R
"Dwayne Johnson says he might want to run for president. He could actually win.
","Conservatives efforts to recruit a candidate to compete against Donald Trump may have only been able to come up with David French, a National Review writer, who is merely contemplating the possibility of running. But last week, a new potential candidate stepped up to the stage, if not for this race, possibly for a future one. Dwayne Johnson, the actor formerly known by his professional wrestling moniker The Rock, told British GQ that hes considered a different kind of career.

Ill be honest, I havent ruled politics out. Im not being coy when I say that, but at the moment I am not sure, Johnson said. I cant deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring. And beyond that, it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on peoples lives on a global scale. But there are a lot of other things I want to do first.

The prospect of yet another former reality-television star running for higher office may feel improbable at best and horrifying at worst, given Trumps performance in the 2016 campaign thus far. And I cant vouch for Johnsons position on the issues  though hes registered as a Republican and has appeared at the Republican convention to boost voter registration,* hes generally talked less about actual policy and spent more time flashing his famously winning smile:


But just as I was an early champion of Johnsons acting abilities  hes fascinating as a gay, closeted driver in Be Cool, mesmerizing as a an amnesiac who is not doing well in the post-apocalypse in Southland Tales and one of the funniest parts of Michael Bays wildly underrated Pain & Gain  Ive long thought that Johnson had a weirdly plausible path to a political career.

He grew up all around the country because of his fathers job but makes his home in Florida, an important state in presidential election years and the place where he played football for the University of Miami. (The locker room was named for him after he made a major donation). Since his pivot to movie stardom, Johnson has become one of the most consistently likable celebrities in America, as measured by the Q Scores Company; hed begin any race not just with high name recognition, but also with high favorable ratings. Johnson is even descended from James Bowles, a free black man who fought with the British during the Revolutionary War when the kingdom offered land and freedom to black Americans who joined their side. (His mothers side of the family is Samoan.)

For a Republican Party that was desperate to woo nonwhite voters before Donald Trump tossed his toupee in the ring, and will be even harder-pressed to woo them once our present mess is over, Johnson could be the sort of person the GOP tries to renovate into a viable candidate.

If he doesnt have policy or issue bona fides, Johnsons relative silence on substance also means he doesnt have a record that can be used to tar him as some sort of flip-flopper. And he could also make a series of carefully selected charitable and political donations designed to start building a record of positions. Its easier to teach talking points than charisma, as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) experienced earlier this year.

Of course, if he really was going to try to follow Ronald Reagans path to the presidency, Johnson would certainly have to run for something else first. And he could do it as early as this year: Johnson has until June 24 to get on the primary ballot in Florida and join the candidates who are competing for the Senate seat Marco Rubio decided to vacate when he ran for president.

The prospect of The Rock sitting through committee hearings might be vaguely ridiculous, and a governorship would probably require him to take fewer potentially damaging votes. But the lesson of this year in American politics is that stranger things can always happen. And Trump is proof that if our politics are turning into reality-television competitions, the results could always be worse.",R
"Millions of ordinary Americans support Donald Trump. Here's why
","Let us now address the greatest American mystery at the moment: what motivates the supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump?

I call it a mystery because the working-class white people who make up the bulk of Trumps fan base show up in amazing numbers for the candidate, filling stadiums and airport hangars, but their views, by and large, do not appear in our prestige newspapers. On their opinion pages, these publications take care to represent demographic categories of nearly every kind, but blue-collar is one they persistently overlook. The views of working-class people are so foreign to that universe that when New York Times columnist Nick Kristof wanted to engage a Trump supporter last week, he made one up, along with this imaginary persons responses to his questions.

When members of the professional class wish to understand the working-class Other, they traditionally consult experts on the subject. And when these authorities are asked to explain the Trump movement, they always seem to zero in on one main accusation: bigotry. Only racism, they tell us, is capable of powering a movement like Trumps, which is blowing through the inherited structure of the Republican party like a tornado through a cluster of McMansions.

Trump himself provides rather excellent evidence for this finding. The man is an insult clown who has systematically gone down the list of American ethnic groups and offended them each in turn. He wants to deport millions upon millions of undocumented immigrants. He wants to bar Muslims from visiting the United States. He admires various foreign strongmen and dictators, and has even retweeted a quote from Mussolini. This gold-plated buffoon has in turn drawn the enthusiastic endorsement of leading racists from across the spectrum of intolerance, a gorgeous mosaic of haters, each of them quivering excitedly at the prospect of getting a real, honest-to-god bigot in the White House.


All this stuff is so insane, so wildly outrageous, that the commentariat has deemed it to be the entirety of the Trump campaign. Trump appears to be a racist, so racism must be what motivates his armies of followers. And so, on Saturday, New York Times columnist Timothy Egan blamed none other than the people for Trumps racism: Donald Trumps supporters know exactly what he stands for: hatred of immigrants, racial superiority, a sneering disregard of the basic civility that binds a society.

Stories marveling at the stupidity of Trump voters are published nearly every day. Articles that accuse Trumps followers of being bigots have appeared by the hundreds, if not the thousands. Conservatives have written them; liberals have written them; impartial professionals have written them. The headline of a recent Huffington Post column announced, bluntly, that Trump Won Super Tuesday Because America is Racist. A New York Times reporter proved that Trumps followers were bigots by coordinating a map of Trump support with a map of racist Google searches. Everyone knows it: Trumps followers passions are nothing more than the ignorant blurtings of the white American id, driven to madness by the presence of a black man in the White House. The Trump movement is a one-note phenomenon, a vast surge of race-hate. Its partisans are not only incomprehensible, they are not really worth comprehending.

* * *
Or so were told. Last week, I decided to watch several hours of Trump speeches for myself. I saw the man ramble and boast and threaten and even seem to gloat when protesters were ejected from the arenas in which he spoke. I was disgusted by these things, as I have been disgusted by Trump for 20 years. But I also noticed something surprising. In each of the speeches I watched, Trump spent a good part of his time talking about an entirely legitimate issue, one that could even be called leftwing.

Yes, Donald Trump talked about trade. In fact, to judge by how much time he spent talking about it, trade may be his single biggest concern  not white supremacy. Not even his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, the issue that first won him political fame. He did it again during the debate on 3 March: asked about his political excommunication by Mitt Romney, he chose to pivot and talk about  trade.

It seems to obsess him: the destructive free-trade deals our leaders have made, the many companies that have moved their production facilities to other lands, the phone calls he will make to those companies CEOs in order to threaten them with steep tariffs unless they move back to the US.

Trump embellished this vision with another favorite leftwing idea: under his leadership, the government would start competitive bidding in the drug industry. (We dont competitively bid! he marveled  another true fact, a legendary boondoggle brought to you by the George W Bush administration.) Trump extended the critique to the military-industrial complex, describing how the government is forced to buy lousy but expensive airplanes thanks to the power of industry lobbyists.

Thus did he hint at his curious selling proposition: because he is personally so wealthy, a fact about which he loves to boast, Trump himself is unaffected by business lobbyists and donations. And because he is free from the corrupting power of modern campaign finance, famous deal-maker Trump can make deals on our behalf that are good instead of bad. The chance that he will actually do so, of course, is small. He appears to be a hypocrite on this issue as well as so many other things. But at least Trump is saying this stuff.

All this surprised me because, for all the articles about Trump I had read in recent months, I didnt recall trade coming up very often. Trump is supposed to be on a one-note crusade for whiteness. Could it be that all this trade stuff is a key to understanding the Trump phenomenon?

* * *
Trade is an issue that polarizes Americans by socio-economic status. To the professional class, which encompasses the vast majority of our media figures, economists, Washington officials and Democratic powerbrokers, what they call free trade is something so obviously good and noble it doesnt require explanation or inquiry or even thought. Republican and Democratic leaders alike agree on this, and no amount of facts can move them from their Econ 101 dream.

To the remaining 80 or 90% of America, trade means something very different. Theres a video going around on the internet these days that shows a room full of workers at a Carrier air conditioning plant in Indiana being told by an officer of the company that the factory is being moved to Monterrey, Mexico, and that theyre all going to lose their jobs.

As I watched it, I thought of all the arguments over trade that weve had in this country since the early 1990s, all the sweet words from our economists about the scientifically proven benevolence of free trade, all the ways in which our newspapers mock people who say that treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement allow companies to move jobs to Mexico.

Well, here is a video of a company moving its jobs to Mexico, courtesy of Nafta. This is what it looks like. The Carrier executive talks in that familiar and highly professional HR language about the need to stay competitive and the extremely price-sensitive marketplace. A worker shouts Fuck you! at the executive. The executive asks people to please be quiet so he can share his information. His information about all of them losing their jobs.

* * *
Now, I have no special reason to doubt the suspicion that Donald Trump is a racist. Either he is one, or (as the comedian John Oliver puts it) he is pretending to be one, which amounts to the same thing.

But there is another way to interpret the Trump phenomenon. A map of his support may coordinate with racist Google searches, but it coordinates even better with deindustrialization and despair, with the zones of economic misery that 30 years of Washingtons free-market consensus have brought the rest of America.

It is worth noting that Trump is making a point of assailing that Indiana air conditioning company from the video in his speeches. What this suggests is that hes telling a tale as much about economic outrage as it is tale of racism on the march. Many of Trumps followers are bigots, no doubt, but many more are probably excited by the prospect of a president who seems to mean it when he denounces our trade agreements and promises to bring the hammer down on the CEO that fired you and wrecked your town, unlike Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Here is the most salient supporting fact: when people talk to white, working-class Trump supporters, instead of simply imagining what they might say, they find that what most concerns these people is the economy and their place in it. I am referring to a study just published by Working America, a political-action auxiliary of the AFL-CIO, which interviewed some 1,600 white working-class voters in the suburbs of Cleveland and Pittsburgh in December and January.

Support for Donald Trump, the group found, ran strong among these people, even among self-identified Democrats, but not because they are all pining for a racist in the White House. Their favorite aspect of Trump was his attitude, the blunt and forthright way he talks. As far as issues are concerned, immigration placed third among the matters such voters care about, far behind their number one concern: good jobs / the economy.

People are much more frightened than they are bigoted, is how the findings were described to me by Karen Nussbaum, the executive director of Working America. The survey confirmed what we heard all the time: people are fed up, people are hurting, they are very distressed about the fact that their kids dont have a future and that there still hasnt been a recovery from the recession, that every family still suffers from it in one way or another.

Tom Lewandowski, the president of the Northeast Indiana Central Labor Council in Fort Wayne, puts it even more bluntly when I asked him about working-class Trump fans. These people arent racist, not any more than anybody else is, he says of Trump supporters he knows. When Trump talks about trade, we think about the Clinton administration, first with Nafta and then with [Permanent Normal Trade Relations] China, and here in Northeast Indiana, we hemorrhaged jobs.

They look at that, and heres Trump talking about trade, in a ham-handed way, but at least hes representing emotionally. Weve had all the political establishment standing behind every trade deal, and we endorsed some of these people, and then weve had to fight them to get them to represent us.

Now, let us stop and smell the perversity. Left parties the world over were founded to advance the fortunes of working people. But our left party in America  one of our two monopoly parties  chose long ago to turn its back on these peoples concerns, making itself instead into the tribune of the enlightened professional class, a creative class that makes innovative things like derivative securities and smartphone apps. The working people that the party used to care about, Democrats figured, had nowhere else to go, in the famous Clinton-era expression. The party just didnt need to listen to them any longer.

What Lewandowski and Nussbaum are saying, then, should be obvious to anyone whos dipped a toe outside the prosperous enclaves on the two coasts. Ill-considered trade deals and generous bank bailouts and guaranteed profits for insurance companies but no recovery for average people, ever  these policies have taken their toll. As Trump says, we have rebuilt China and yet our country is falling apart. Our infrastructure is falling apart  Our airports are, like, Third World.

Trumps words articulate the populist backlash against liberalism that has been building slowly for decades and may very well occupy the White House itself, whereupon the entire world will be required to take seriously its demented ideas.

Yet still we cannot bring ourselves to look the thing in the eyes. We cannot admit that we liberals bear some of the blame for its emergence, for the frustration of the working-class millions, for their blighted cities and their downward spiraling lives. So much easier to scold them for their twisted racist souls, to close our eyes to the obvious reality of which Trumpism is just a crude and ugly expression: that neoliberalism has well and truly failed.

"Mitt Romney says Donald Trump will change America with 'trickle-down racism
","Park City, Utah (CNN)Mitt Romney suggested Friday that Donald Trump's election could legitimize racism and misogyny, ushering in a change in the moral fabric of American society.

The 2012 Republican nominee, who has openly opposed Trump's candidacy, went further than he has before in outlining to CNN's Wolf Blitzer how the country's character would suffer in a Trump White House. Trump's rhetoric has caused even some other Republicans to label him a racist, and Romney said he would not be able to paper over his incendiary remarks.
""I don't want to see trickle-down racism,"" Romney said in an interview here in a suite overlooking the Wasatch Mountains, where he is hosting his yearly ideas conference. ""I don't want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following. Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America.""
Romney retreat puts spotlight on Trump's fundraising problem in critical stretch
Trump, speaking at a rally in Richmond, Virginia, Friday night, didn't address Romney's criticism directly but did say, ""I am the least racist person, the least racist person that you've ever seen,"" a line he frequently says at campaign events.
By Saturday morning, Trump was directly responding to Romney, tweeting, ""Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is.""
 
Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

He then added, ""Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!""
 
He kept up his attacks while speaking at a campaign rally on Saturday in Tampa, Florida, telling the crowd, ""I don't think he knows what a misogynist is. Don't forget this guy let us down."" He would later double down on the criticism at a campaign event in Pittsburgh.
Romney considering Johnson
Romney, who actively sought to recruit an independent, third-party challenger to Trump, also conceded that a credible candidate will not emerge. But he did show a new openness to one non-Trump candidate, libertarian Gary Johnson, whom he did not rule out voting for.
Johnson's running mate is another former Massachusetts governor, Bill Weld, who once fundraised for Romney. If the ticket was flipped and Weld was the standard-bearer, Romney said he would have no qualms about voting for the libertarian ticket this fall.
Hillary Clinton huddles with top fundraisers
""If Bill Weld were at the top of the ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president,"" Romney said. ""So I'll get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he's someone who I could end up voting for. That's something which I'll evaluate over the coming weeks and months.""
Romney's comments on ""The Situation Room"" are some of the highest-profile support bestowed upon the libertarian ticket, which is almost certain to be less funded compared to the GOP and Democratic lines. He did however express an uneasiness with Johnson, given his position on marijuana legalization.
""Marijuana makes people stupid,"" Romney quipped.
Johnson said Saturday that others should join Romney in giving the Libertarian nominees a closer look.
""I think Mitt Romney hit it on the head. He said, 'Hey, I'm going to check out Gary Johnson and see what he's got to say,'"" he told CNN's Victor Blackwell on ""CNN Newsroom."" ""I think that kind of scrutiny holds up under the light of day.""

Romney once again ruled out running himself, but he was also candid about independent efforts to recruit a challenger. Several sought-after Republicans, including Ben Sasse and author David French, have taken passes.
Orrin Hatch explains friendship with Muhammad Ali
""I think you're not going to find a credible candidate actually running as a third-party contender,"" Romney said. ""The only way to win the White House, in my view, is to become a nominee of either the Republican or the Democrat Party, and simply running to be a spoiler would not give the American people I think the chance to express their own views about Mr. Trump or about Secretary Clinton.""
Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, appearing later on ""The Situation Room,"" dismissed Romney's criticism.
""This again is just sour grapes from the establishment who have had the power stripped out of theirs hands by a candidate that they do not like because he has managed to do something they have been unable to do for decades,"" Pierson said.
And Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted later Friday, ""Respect Mitt and differences but couldn't disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let's stop this and unify.""
 
Respect Mitt and differences but couldn't disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let's stop this and unify.

In Richmond, Trump alluded to his critics, though he didn't mention Romney by name.
Clinton donor received top spot on State Department intel board
""These poor people going, 'Never Trump, never Trump' -- they've been doing it for months. They did it with Indiana, they did it with New York -- 'We're going to win New York' -- and I won in a massive landslide.""
'My choice is different'
Romney again speculated about what might be in Trump's tax returns, which he has repeatedly declined to release, claiming that he's under audit. Asked what might be in there, Romney referred to a months-ago comment by Trump that he could not lose support even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City.
""He's calculated that he could get support even if he shot someone, but if he released his taxes, he'd lose support,"" Romney said. ""So there's something in those taxes that's even worse than shooting someone on Fifth Avenue.""
Yet Romney declined to criticize other Republicans who have harbored similar feelings about Trump but endorsed him. Romney's mentee and vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, has uneasily backed Trump, but Romney declined multiple chances to pass judgment on the speaker's decision.
""Are you disappointed Paul Ryan has endorsed him?"" Blitzer asked.
""I wish everybody in the Republican Party had rejected Mr. Trump and chosen someone else,"" Romney said. ""But my choice is different than that of the other people, and I'm certainly not going to argue with them about their choice.""
Sanders to meet with top supporters to discuss campaign's future
Romney also shared some disappointment in the Republican candidates who wooed him fervently for support, saying they largely shied away from a fight with Trump in the primary. For much of the campaign, Republican candidates squabbled to position themselves as the chief Trump alternative.
""I don't think he got the scrutiny applied to him that is typically applied to a front-runner by the people running against him,"" he said, lamenting that they were ""firing at each other."" ""Jeb Bush had a super PAC of over $100 million. And they focused their fire on Marco Rubio and others, as opposed to focusing it on the front-runner.""
But if Romney had ran?
""Had I been in the race,"" he said, ""I can assure you, I would have taken him on.""",R

"Donald Trump's nomination is the first time American politics has left me truly afraid
","Tonight, Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican Partys nomination for president of the United States.

And I am, for the first time since I began covering American politics, genuinely afraid.

Donald Trump is not a man who should be president. This is not an ideological judgment. This is not something I would say about Mitt Romney or Marco Rubio. This is not a disagreement over Donald Trumps tax plan or his climate policies. This is about Trumps character, his temperament, his impulsiveness, his basic decency.

Back in February, I wrote that Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory. He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament; he's a racist, a sexist, and a demagogue, but he's also a narcissist, a bully, and a dilettante. He lies so constantly and so fluently that it's hard to know if he even realizes he's lying. He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash.

He has had plenty of time to prove me, and everyone else, wrong. But he hasnt. He has not become more responsible or more sober, more decent or more generous, more considered or more informed, more careful or more kind. He has continued to retweet white supremacists, make racist comments, pick unnecessary fights, contradict himself on the stump, and show an almost gleeful disinterest in building a real campaign or learning about policy.

He has, instead, run a campaign based on stoking fear and playing to resentment. His speech tonight invoked a nightmarish American hellscape that doesn't actually exist. His promise to restore order made him sound like the aspiring strongman his critics fear him to be. ""I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end,"" he said. ""Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.""

Here is what we know  truly know  about Trump. Here is why he should not be president.

Trump is vindictive. So far, the unifying theme of Trumps convention is that the leader of the opposition party should be thrown in jail. Trump didnt like the Washington Posts coverage of his campaign, so he barred its reporters from his rallies and threatened to use the power of the presidency to bring an antitrust suit against the Post's owner, Jeff Bezos.

He was upset that Ohio didnt vote for him, so he sat its delegation in the cheap seats, even though the state is hosting the convention. He was angry about an interview his ex-ghostwriter gave to the New Yorker, so he sent his lawyers after him. He hates the protesters who interrupt his campaigns, so he said he would look into paying the legal fees of a supporter who sucker-punched one of them.

Imagine Donald Trump with the powers of the presidency. Imagine what he could do  what he would do  to those who crossed him.

Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump kicked off his campaign calling Mexican immigrants murderers and rapists. He responded to Ted Cruzs surge in Iowa by calling for a ban on Muslim travel. He sought to discredit a US-born judge by saying his rulings were suspect because of his ""Mexican heritage."" Trumps campaign is certainly the first time in my memory that a sitting speaker of the House has had to describe something his partys nominee said as ""the textbook definition of a racist comment.""

This is not a man who should be put in charge of an increasingly diverse country that needs to find allies in an increasingly diverse world.

Trump is a sexist. Stories of Trumps casual sexism abound, but during the campaign, it was women who questioned him who felt the full force of his misogyny. The first Republican debate, for instance, was hosted by Fox News and moderated by Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier, and Chris Wallace. Kelly wasnt obviously tougher on Trump than her colleagues, but she was the antagonist he focused on, retweeting a follower who said she was ""a bimbo"" and saying she had ""blood coming out of her  wherever.""

After Carly Fiorina challenged him in a debate, Trump said to Rolling Stone, ""Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?"" After Hillary Clinton needed to take a bathroom break during a debate, Trump told the crowd, ""It's too disgusting. Don't say it, it's disgusting.""

Its not just during political campaigns that this side of Trump emerges. Trump once told his friend Philip Johnson that the secret to women was ""[y]ou have to treat 'em like shit.""

Trump is a liar. Trump boasts constantly that he had the judgment and foresight to oppose the Iraq War. But he didnt. On September 11, 2002, Trump was asked by Howard Stern whether he supported the invasion of Iraq. ""Yeah, I guess so,"" he replied. Trump has not sought to explain these comments or offer evidence of an alternative judgment he offered elsewhere. He just lies about this, and he does so often.

But thats true for Trump across many issues. He says his health care plan will insure everyone, when it will do nothing of the kind. He says his tax plan raises taxes on the wealthy when it actually cuts them sharply. Trump has lied about his net worth, his reasons for not releasing his tax returns, and his charitable donations. He lies easily, fluently, shamelessly, constantly.

Trump is a narcissist. Trumps towering self-regard worked for him as a real estate developer. His real business was licensing his name out for building, menswear, golf courses, steaks. A bit of a narcissism is necessary to become a global brand. But the trait is maladaptive in a presidential candidate.

The most recent example was the 28 minutes he spent talking about himself when he was supposed to be introducing Mike Pence, his vice presidential candidate, for the first time. The most grotesque example was when he responded to the deadliest mass shooting in American history by tweeting, ""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.""

Trump admires authoritarian dictators for their authoritarianism. When MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin, who ""kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries,"" Trump replied, ""He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country.""

But its not just Putin. Trump has praised Saddam Hussein because ""he killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights."" He said ""you've got to give [Kim Jong Un] credit. He goes in, he takes over, and he's the boss. It's incredible."" Its not just that Trump admires these authoritarians; its that the thing he admires about them is their authoritarianism  their ability to dispense with niceties like a free press, due process, and political opposition.


Trump is a conspiracy theorist. Trump burst onto the scene as a leader of the absurd ""birther"" movement. Hes said that Bill Ayers is the real author of Barack Obamas Dreams From My Father, explained that the unemployment rate in America is really over 40 percent, and suggested that both Antonin Scalia and Vince Foster were murdered.

Trump is very, very gullible. This is related to his conspiracy theories, but Trump has a habit of believing and retweeting bad information that sounds good to him at the time.

This has led to, among other things, Trump retweeting false crime statistics, Trump retweeting Mussolini quotes from a Twitter account called Il Duce, Trump promoting a fake video claiming a protester who rushed his stage was sent by ISIS, and Trump endorsing a National Enquirer report suggesting Ted Cruzs dad helped kill JFK. When pressed about these sundry embarrassments, Trump said, ""All I know is whats on the internet.""

Thats a reasonable response from your uncle who forwards you weird email chains, but not from a presidential candidate.

Trump doesnt apologize, and his defensiveness escalates situations. On Monday night, it became very clear that Melania Trumps 2016 convention speech had lifted two paragraphs from Michelle Obamas 2008 convention speech. The error was an embarrassment, but it could have been dispatched quickly by simply admitting fault and apologizing.

Instead, the Trump campaign turned it into a multi-day story and a character issue by denying anything had happened and blaming Hillary Clinton. This is ""an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, how she seeks out to demean her and take her down,"" said campaign chair Paul Manafort, in one of the most genuinely ridiculous comments in recent American history.

The campaign also tried to argue that Michelle Obama doesnt own the English language, and that similar language was used by Twilight Sparkle, a My Little Pony (Im serious). Finally, days later, the Trump campaign admitted there was plagiarism and blamed a miscommunication between Melania and her speechwriter.

A similar pattern played out when Trump tweeted an anti-Hillary meme that superimposed a Star of David atop a pile of money and accused Clinton of corruption. The image was obviously anti-Semitic, and the Trump campaign quickly took it down. But Trump himself went on a Twitter rampage, arguing that what was clearly a Star of David was actually just a sheriffs star, or maybe just a regular old star, and that the campaign shouldnt have removed the offending meme in the first place.

So far, these examples are farce, but as Tim Lee writes, this tendency in the Oval Office could lead to tragedy: ""[Trumps] behavior on the campaign trail suggests that he would be unlikely to admit mistakes and defuse tense situations. Instead, his first instinct would be to escalate every conflict in an effort to bully foreign adversaries into giving him his way. That might work in some cases. But in others  especially against powerful countries like China or Russia  the results could be disastrous.""

Trump surrounds himself with sycophants. It's tradition for presidential candidates to release a note from their physician testifying to their fitness to fulfill the duties of the presidency. On December 14, Donald Trump submitted his entry to this quadrennial custom.

""If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,"" Dr. Harold Bornstein writes. ""His blood pressure, 110/65, and laboratory test results were astonishingly excellent.  His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary.""

This is  not how most doctor notes read. ""Reached for comment regarding this, a spokesperson at the American Medical Association just giggled,"" reported the Daily Beast.

There are many positions where one might accept a pliable crony. But ""personal physician"" should not be one of them. The fact that Trump would entrust his health to a doctor who would sign off on a note like this should terrify his family and friends. But more than that, it should disqualify him from the presidency.

Trump has proven too lazy to learn about policy. Trump didnt know much about policy when the campaign started, and as far as anyone can tell, he hasnt made any obvious effort to rectify that.

The latest and most damaging example is his interview with the New York Times, in which he said he would not automatically defend NATO countries against attack from Russia. Its not obvious Trump meant to say that, or even knew what saying that meant, as Manafort immediately began denying Trump had ever said it. (The Times subsequently released a transcript showing that, yes, Trump had said it.)

But this is a pattern for Trump, who doesnt bother to come up with convincing answers even to obvious questions, and definitely has not put in the time to develop a deep understanding of the issues he might face as president. As Matt Yglesias wrote, this is very much a choice Trump has made. ""Trump is now the GOP nominee, and there are hundreds of professional Republican Party politicians and operatives around the country who would gladly help him become a sharper, better-informed candidate. It doesnt happen because he cant be bothered.""

Trump has run an incompetent campaign and convention. As brilliant as Trump has been in securing media attention for himself and channeling the anxieties of conservative voters, he hasnt bothered to build a real campaign organization, and his convention has been a festival of unforced errors.

This is the context of Melania Trumps plagiarism, of Ted Cruzs anti-endorsement, of the night that was supposed to be about jobs and the economy but was actually about Benghazi and jailing Hillary Clinton. In isolation, these are gaffes, mistakes, bad luck. Together, though, they tell a damning story of organizational incompetence.

The most generous interpretation of this is that Trump is capable of running an effective organization, but hes just not interested in conventions and field operations in the way he is interested in golf courses and condos. Others have certainly testified to the trouble Trump has focusing on tasks that dont engage him. His former ghostwriter says, ""He has no attention span."" Unfortunately, the president actually needs to focus on all kinds of dull and unpleasant tasks.

Trump is a bully. Trump won the Republican nomination by proving that even adults can be bullied with schoolyard taunts. There was ""low-energy Jeb,"" and ""Little Marco,"" and ""Lyin Ted,"" and now weve got ""Crooked Hillary."" Trump made fun of Rand Pauls looks and Chris Christies weight and Carly Fiorinas face and a New York Times reporters physical disability.

It seems like this shouldnt have to be said, but its better to be kind than cruel, and theres a deep, instinctual cruelty in Trump  he finds peoples weak spots, their insecurities, and he exposes them in front of crowds.

Trump has regularly incited or justified violence among his supporters. At a rally in St. Louis, Donald Trump lamented that ""nobody wants to hurt each other anymore.""

Yes, lamented.

The topic was protesters, and Trump's frustration was clear. ""They're being politically correct the way they take them out,"" he sighed. ""Protesters, they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore. There used to be consequences. There are none anymore.""

Earlier in the campaign, two of Trumps supporters attacked a homeless Mexican man and told the police, ""Donald Trump was right  all these illegals need to be deported."" Trumps response? ""I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again.""

The simple fact of it is that Donald Trump should not be president of the United States. That is not because he is too conservative, as some Democrats would have it, or because he is not conservative enough, as many Republicans would have it. Its because the presidency is a powerful job where mistakes can kill millions, and whoever holds it needs to take that power seriously and wield it responsibly. Trump has had ample opportunity to demonstrate his sense of seriousness and responsibility. He has failed.

It is said that the benefit of Americas long presidential campaigns is they offer the candidates time to show us who they really are. Trump has shown us who he really is. He is a person who should not be president. That he is being brought this close to the presidency  that he is one major mistake by Hillary Clinton away from winning it  should scare us all. It certainly scares me.",R
"Stop Pretending You Don't Know Why People Hate Hillary Clinton
","Why Is Clinton disliked?

Why the hate for Hillary?

Why do people hate Hillary Clinton so much?

Is it because of partisanship?

Or a hard-fought primary?

Maybe, NBC once suggested, its because shes not a train wreck.

Funny how the answers seem to be everything but the obvious.

We go on endlessly about how untrustworthy she is, while fact checkers rank her as the second-most honest prominent politician in the country. (And her opponent as by far the least.)

We say that she has trouble with transparency, while her opponent refuses to release his taxes and the current administration sets records for secrecy.

We decry her ties to corporations and the financial industry, while supporting a walking tax shelter or mourning the exit of a president whose re-election was funded by a record-shattering Wall Street haul.

We list so very many explanations, all of them complete bullshit.

In truth, the Hillary haters seem to resent her more than disagree with her. They demand to be humored and catered to. They hold her to wildly different standards than her male counterparts. They regard her with an unprecedented degree of suspicion. Above all, they really, really want to see her punished. And an aggressive male presenceeven if dangerously incompetentseems to comfort a great many of them.

Everyone but them knows damn well why.

Bad news for the haters: History is decidedly unafraid of the woman card. It doesnt care how many people will stand on tables today and swear theyd feel the same if she were a man. It will see us for what we area sick society, driven by misogyny and pathetically struggling to come to terms with the fact that women do not exist solely to nurture.

If that answer isnt as nuanced as the average thinkpiece, thats because we, as a people, are not. No matter how many branches have formed, they all emerged from the same seed, planted way back when Bill Clinton first ran for governor. She wouldnt be so suspicious of the press, or so measured in her presentation, or so any one of a thousand other things, if she had been born a man.

The lengths we go to in order to rationalize this all will be seen, in retrospect, as extraordinary.

When the Bush administration was discovered to have erased millions of emails illegally sent by 22 administration officials through private, RNC-owned accounts, in order to thwart an investigation into the politically motivated firing of eight US attorneys, just one talk show covered it that Sunday.

When Mitt Romney wiped servers, sold government hard drives to his closest aides and spent $100,000 in taxpayer money to destroy his administrations emails, it was barely an issue.

When Hillary Clinton asked Colin Powell how he managed to use a Blackberry while serving as Secretary of State, he replied by detailing his method of intentionally bypassing federal record-keeping laws:

I didnt have a Blackberry. What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.

... There is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it [sic] government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law.

Yet the fact that Hillary Clinton emailed through a private server and didnt use it to cover anything up is somehow the defining issue of her campaign. My God, people cry, anyone else would be in jail!

Or is the real scandal that her family runs but does not profit from a charitable foundation awarded an A grade by Charity Watch, a four out of four star rating by Charity Navigator and responsible for helping 435 million people in 180 countries get things like clean drinking water and HIV medication? Because the AP seems super concerned that she encountered people who donated to itspecifically Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunusin her official capacity as Secretary of State.

It should at this point be observed that her opponent is a shameless con artist who has built an empire bilking people with fake businesses, fake universities, fake charities and, now, a fake campaign. Last week, he told a lie every three minutes and fifteen seconds. Oh, and did we mention that he, like so many of his online supporters, is a goddamn Russian stooge? I tried to list all of the dumb, awful stuff that he does every day and I cannot come close to keeping up.

Voters, it seems, are his easiest marks yet.

And it isnt just Republicans. The double standards are even more transparent on the left.

Back in the mid-90s, Clintons persistent unwillingness to hide the fact that she was a thinking human female really freaked the center-left establishment out. Michael Moore observed that, [Maureen Dowd] is fixated on trashing Hillary Rodham in the way liberals love to do, to prove theyre not really liberal. The bashing slowly morphed into a creepy, extraordinary sort of policing.

Since then, Clinton racked up a Senate voting record more liberal than any nominee since Mondale. Her 2008 platform was slightly to Obamas left on domestic issues. Her 2016 platform was barely to the right of self-proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders.

Yet, we have all heard and seen countless liberal posers passionately decrying her far right voting record, untrustworthy promises or ever-changing policy positions. Jon Stewart recently called Clinton a bright woman without the courage of her convictions, because I dont know what they even are. Because if he doesnt know, she must not have any, right?

In fact, there is a very lengthy trail of public records all pointing in the same direction. If you cant figure out which, maybe the problem is you.

Yet, many on the left who gladly voted for John Kerry, two years after he voted to authorize the Iraq war, now say they couldnt possibly vote for Clinton, because she did, too.

And view her with contempt for opposing same-sex marriage in 2008, while fawning over men like Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders, who held the same position at the same time.

Its time to stop pretending that this is about substance. This is about an eagerness to believe that a woman who seeks power will say or do anything to get it. This is about a Lady MacBeth stereotype that, frankly, should never have existed in the first place. This is about the one thing no one wants to admit its about.

Consider, for a moment, two people. One, as a young woman at the beginning of a promising legal career, went door to door searching for ways to guarantee an education to the countless disabled and disadvantaged children who had fallen through the cracks. The other, as a young millionaire, exacted revenge on his recently deceased brothers family by cutting off the medical insurance desperately needed by his nephews newborn son, who at eighteen months of age was suffering from violent seizures brought on by a rare neurological disorder.

What kind of a society treats these two people as equal in any way? What kind of society even considers the latter over the former for its highest office?

Generations from now, people will shake their heads at this moment in time, when the first female major party presidential nomineecompetent, qualified and more thoroughly vetted than any non-incumbent candidate in historyendured the humiliation of being likened to such an obvious grifter, ignoramus and hate monger.

We deserve the shame that we will bear.",R
"Donald Trump Voters Just Hear Me Out
","This is my last column until after the election, so Id like to address the people least likely to read it: Donald Trump voters. Who knows? Maybe Ill get lucky and a few of them will buy fish wrapped in this column, and theyll accidentally peruse it! Desperate times call for desperate measures.

While Ive opposed the Trump candidacy from the start, Ive never disparaged Trump voters. Some are friends and neighbors; theyre all fellow Americans. We should take their concerns seriously. But we should also demand that they be serious, that they draw distinctions between these two presidential candidates.

Yes, Hillary Clinton is a flawed leader  but in the way so many presidents were. We know her flaws: She has a weakness for secrecy, occasionally fudges truths, has fawning aides and a husband who lacks discipline when it comes to moneymaking and women. But she is not indecent, and that is an important distinction. And shes studious, has sought out people of substance on every issue and has taken the job of running for president seriously.

Trump is not only a flawed politician, hes an indecent human being. Hes boasted of assaulting women  prompting 11 to come forward to testify that he did just that to them; his defense is that he could not have assaulted these women because they werent pretty enough.

Hes created a university that was charged with defrauding its students. Hes been charged with discriminating against racial minorities in his rental properties. Hes stiffed countless vendors, from piano sellers to major contractors. Hes refused to disclose his tax returns because they likely reveal that hes paid no federal taxes for years, is in bed with dodgy financiers and doesnt give like he says to charity.

Hes compared the sacrifice of parents of a soldier killed in Iraq to his sacrifice of building tall buildings. Hes vowed, if elected, to prosecute his campaign rival.

We have never seen such behaviors in a presidential candidate.

At the same time, Trump has shown no ability to talk about any policy issue with any depth. Harlan Cobens debate-night tweet last month had it right: On Aleppo he sounds like a fifth grader giving a book report on a book he never read.

I understand why many Trump supporters have lost faith in Washington and want to just shake things up. When you shake things up with a studied plan and a clear idea of where you want to get to, you can open new futures. But when you shake things up, guided by one-liners and no moral compass, you can cause enormous instability and systemic vertigo.

PRIVACY POLICY
But there is an even more important reason Trump supporters, particularly less-educated white males, should be wary of his bluster: His policies wont help them. Trump promises to bring their jobs back. But most of their jobs didnt go to a Mexican. They went to a microchip.

The idea that large numbers of manual factory jobs can be returned to America if we put up a wall with Mexico or renegotiate our trade deals is a fantasy. Trump ignores the fact that manufacturing is still by far the largest sector of the U.S. economy. Indeed, our factories now produce twice what they did in 1984  but with one-third fewer workers.

Trump cant change that. Machines and software will keep devouring, and spawning, more work of all kinds. Did you hear that IBMs cognitive computer, Watson, helped to create a pop song, Not Easy, with the Grammy-winning producer Alex da Kid? The song was released on Oct. 21, IBM noted, and within 48 hours it climbed to No. 4 on iTuness Hot Tracks.

No one knows for certain how we deal with this new race with and against machines, but I can assure you its not Trumps way  build walls, restrict trade, give huge tax cuts to the rich. The best jobs in the future are going to be what I call STEMpathy jobs  jobs that blend STEM skills (science, technology, engineering, math) with human empathy. We dont know what many of them will look like yet.

The smartest thing we can do now is to keep our economy as open and flexible as possible  to get the change signals first and be able to quickly adapt; create the opportunity for every American to engage in lifelong learning, because whatever jobs emerge will require more knowledge; make sure that learning stresses as much of the humanities and human interactive skills as hard sciences; make sure we have an immigration policy that continues to attract the worlds most imaginative risk-takers; and strengthen our safety nets, because this era will leave more people behind.

This is the only true path to American greatness in the 21st century. Trump wants to make America great in ways that are just not available anymore. What do we have to lose by trying his way? Trump asks. The answer is: everything that actually makes us great. When the world gets this fast, small errors in navigation have huge consequences.

While Clinton has failed to inspire, her instincts and ideas will keep us hewing to basically the right course. And however great her flaws, she is still in the zone of human decency. Trump is not.

We can never be great as a country with a president with the warped values of Donald Trump. I pray that in the end at least some Trump voters, my fellow Americans, will see that.",R
"Under Sanders income and jobs would soar economist says
","Median income would soar by more than $22,000. Nearly 26 million jobs would be created. The unemployment rate would fall to 3.8%.
Those are just a few of the things that would happen if Bernie Sanders became president and his ambitious economic program were put into effect, according to an analysis given exclusively to CNNMoney. The first comprehensive look at the impact of all of Sanders' spending and tax proposals on the economy was done by Gerald Friedman, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor.
This more sweeping analysis was not commissioned by the candidate, though Sanders' policy director called it ""outstanding work."" Friedman has worked with Sanders in the past, but has never received any compensation. The Vermont senator asked Friedman to estimate the cost of Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan -- which came out to $13.8 trillion over 10 years -- and included the analysis when he unveiled his proposal last month.
Friedman, who believes in democratic socialism like the candidate, found that if Sanders became president -- and was able to push his plan through Congress -- median household income would be $82,200 by 2026, far higher than the $59,300 projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
In addition, poverty would plummet to a record low 6%, as opposed to the CBO's forecast of 13.9%. The U.S. economy would grow by 5.3% per year, instead of 2.1%, and the nation's $1.3 trillion deficit would turn into a large surplus by Sanders' second term.
Other economists, however, feel that Friedman's analysis is overly optimistic, saying it would be difficult to achieve that level of economic prosperity. Last week, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Sanders' plan to pay for health care would fall short by at least $3 trillion.
Related: 5 unanswered questions about Bernie Sanders' health care plan
Sanders' plan to pour $14.5 trillion into the economy -- including spending on infrastructure and youth employment, increasing Social Security benefits, making college free and expanding health care and family leave -- would juice GDP and productivity. (Friedman reduces the cost of Medicare-for-all to $10.7 trillion because he estimates the government would save $3.1 trillion by eliminating tax breaks for health insurance premiums.)
Also, Sanders would raise the minimum wage, as well as shift income from the rich to the middle and working class through tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.
""Like the New Deal of the 1930s, Senator Sanders' program is designed to do more than merely increase economic activity,"" Friedman writes. It will ""promote a more just prosperity, broadly-based with a narrowing of economy inequality.""
Many presidential hopefuls say their economic programs would boost growth. Donald Trump and Jeb Bush justify their big tax cuts by saying GDP would grow at a 4% rate. But their plans have been panned by experts as overly optimistic.
Friedman, however, argues that Sanders' plan would be more stimulative because it is pouring money into the economy, as opposed to cutting taxes. Several of Sanders' proposals -- such as spending $1 trillion on infrastructure -- will happen in the first few years of his administration.
The thinking goes: This enhanced government spending would increase demand on businesses, who would then hire more workers to meet their needs. The increase in employment will prompt people to buy more, leading other businesses to hire.
""If there is more spending, people will have more to do,"" Friedman said, noting that the share of the population with jobs could be restored to its 1999 level of more than 64%, up from its current 59.6% rate.
Related: Can Bernie Sanders deliver free college for all? Not so easily
Sanders' policy director, Warren Gunnels, also defended the estimates, noting the candidate is thinking big.
""We haven't had such an ambitious agenda to rebuild the middle class since Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Johnson,"" he said.
 Sword swallowers and acrobats turn out for Bernie in Brooklyn

Still, some experts question whether the effects would be that large.
Stimulating demand can boost a weak economy during a recession, but ""it's harder to accept as a long-run growth strategy,"" said William Gale, the former director of Brookings' Economic Studies Program.
Also, it would be very difficult to achieve and maintain an economic growth rate of 5.3% per year after inflation. That target hasn't been hit consistently since the 1960s, when technology was providing big advancements, the workforce was younger and there was increased demand for American products worldwide as other countries fully recovered from World War II.
""The 5.3% number is a fantasy,"" said Jim Kessler, senior vice president at Third Way, a centrist think tank.",R
"The rise of American authoritarianism
","The American media, over the past year, has been trying to work out something of a mystery: Why is the Republican electorate supporting a far-right, orange-toned populist with no real political experience, who espouses extreme and often bizarre views? How has Donald Trump, seemingly out of nowhere, suddenly become so popular?

What's made Trump's rise even more puzzling is that his support seems to cross demographic lines  education, income, age, even religiosity  that usually demarcate candidates. And whereas most Republican candidates might draw strong support from just one segment of the party base, such as Southern evangelicals or coastal moderates, Trump currently does surprisingly well from the Gulf Coast of Florida to the towns of upstate New York, and he won a resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses.

VII. America's changing social landscape 
VIII. What authoritarians want 
IX. How authoritarians will change American politics 
Perhaps strangest of all, it wasn't just Trump but his supporters who seemed to have come out of nowhere, suddenly expressing, in large numbers, ideas far more extreme than anything that has risen to such popularity in recent memory. In South Carolina, a CBS News exit poll found that 75 percent of Republican voters supported banning Muslims from the United States. A PPP poll found that a third of Trump voters support banning gays and lesbians from the country. Twenty percent said Lincoln shouldn't have freed the slaves.

Last September, a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst named Matthew MacWilliams realized that his dissertation research might hold the answer to not just one but all three of these mysteries.

MacWilliams studies authoritarianism  not actual dictators, but rather a psychological profile of individual voters that is characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders. People who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear.

So MacWilliams naturally wondered if authoritarianism might correlate with support for Trump.

He polled a large sample of likely voters, looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism. What he found was astonishing: Not only did authoritarianism correlate, but it seemed to predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator. He later repeated the same poll in South Carolina, shortly before the primary there, and found the same results, which he published in Vox:

  
As it turns out, MacWilliams wasn't the only one to have this realization. Miles away, in an office at Vanderbilt University, a professor named Marc Hetherington was having his own aha moment. He realized that he and a fellow political scientist, the University of North Carolina's Jonathan Weiler, had essentially predicted Trump's rise back in 2009, when they discovered something that would turn out to be far more significant than they then realized.

That year, Hetherington and Weiler published a book about the effects of authoritarianism on American politics. Through a series of experiments and careful data analysis, they had come to a surprising conclusion: Much of the polarization dividing American politics was fueled not just by gerrymandering or money in politics or the other oft-cited variables, but by an unnoticed but surprisingly large electoral group  authoritarians.

Their book concluded that the GOP, by positioning itself as the party of traditional values and law and order, had unknowingly attracted what would turn out to be a vast and previously bipartisan population of Americans with authoritarian tendencies.

This trend had been accelerated in recent years by demographic and economic changes such as immigration, which ""activated"" authoritarian tendencies, leading many Americans to seek out a strongman leader who would preserve a status quo they feel is under threat and impose order on a world they perceive as increasingly alien.

Trump embodies the classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive
These Americans with authoritarian views, they found, were sorting into the GOP, driving polarization. But they were also creating a divide within the party, at first latent, between traditional Republican voters and this group whose views were simultaneously less orthodox and, often, more extreme.

Over time, Hetherington and Weiler had predicted, that sorting would become more and more pronounced. And so it was all but inevitable that, eventually, authoritarians would gain enough power within the GOP to make themselves heard.

At the time, even Hetherington and Weiler did not realize the explosive implications: that their theory, when followed to its natural conclusion, predicted a looming and dramatic transformation of American politics. But looking back now, the ramifications of their research seem disturbingly clear.

Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things. And the extreme nature of authoritarians' fears, and of their desire to challenge threats with force, would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics  and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms.

A candidate like Donald Trump.

Even Hetherington was shocked to discover quite how right their theory had been. In the early fall of 2015, as Trump's rise baffled most American journalists and political scientists, he called Weiler. He asked, over and over, ""Can you believe this? Can you believe this?""

This winter, I got in touch with Hetherington, MacWilliams, and several other political scientists who study authoritarianism. I wanted to better understand the theory that seemed to have predicted, with such eerie accuracy, Trump's rise. And, like them, I wanted to find out what the rise of authoritarian politics meant for American politics. Was Trump just the start of something bigger?

These political scientists were, at that moment, beginning to grapple with the same question. We agreed there was something important happening here  that was just beginning to be understood.

Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics
Shortly after the Iowa Republican caucus, in which Trump came in a close second, Vox partnered with the Washington-based media and polling company Morning Consult to test American authoritarians along a range of political and social views  and to test some hypotheses we had developed after speaking with the leading political scientists of the field.

What we found is a phenomenon that explains, with remarkable clarity, the rise of Donald Trump  but that is also much larger than him, shedding new light on some of the biggest political stories of the past decade. Trump, it turns out, is just the symptom. The rise of American authoritarianism is transforming the Republican Party and the dynamics of national politics, with profound consequences likely to extend well beyond this election.

I. What is American authoritarianism?

For years now, before anyone thought a person like Donald Trump could possibly lead a presidential primary, a small but respected niche of academic research has been laboring over a question, part political science and part psychology, that had captivated political scientists since the rise of the Nazis.

How do people come to adopt, in such large numbers and so rapidly, extreme political views that seem to coincide with fear of minorities and with the desire for a strongman leader?

To answer that question, these theorists study what they call authoritarianism: not the dictators themselves, but rather the psychological profile of people who, under the right conditions, will desire certain kinds of extreme policies and will seek strongman leaders to implement them.

The political phenomenon we identify as right-wing populism seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed
After an early period of junk science in the mid-20th century, a more serious group of scholars has addressed this question, specifically studying how it plays out in American politics: researchers like Hetherington and Weiler, Stanley Feldman, Karen Stenner, and Elizabeth Suhay, to name just a few.

The field, after a breakthrough in the early 1990s, has come to develop the contours of a grand theory of authoritarianism, culminating quite recently, in 2005, with Stenner's seminal The Authoritarian Dynamic  just in time for that theory to seemingly come true, more rapidly and in greater force than any of them had imagined, in the personage of one Donald Trump and his norm-shattering rise.

According to Stenner's theory, there is a certain subset of people who hold latent authoritarian tendencies. These tendencies can be triggered or ""activated"" by the perception of physical threats or by destabilizing social change, leading those individuals to desire policies and leaders that we might more colloquially call authoritarian.

It is as if, the NYU professor Jonathan Haidt has written, a button is pushed that says, ""In case of moral threat, lock down the borders, kick out those who are different, and punish those who are morally deviant.""

Authoritarians are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump  and will persist as a force in American politics
Authoritarians prioritize social order and hierarchies, which bring a sense of control to a chaotic world. Challenges to that order  diversity, influx of outsiders, breakdown of the old order  are experienced as personally threatening because they risk upending the status quo order they equate with basic security.

This is, after all, a time of social change in America. The country is becoming more diverse, which means that many white Americans are confronting race in a way they have never had to before. Those changes have been happening for a long time, but in recent years they have become more visible and harder to ignore. And they are coinciding with economic trends that have squeezed working-class white people.

When they face physical threats or threats to the status quo, authoritarians support policies that seem to offer protection against those fears. They favor forceful, decisive action against things they perceive as threats. And they flock to political leaders who they believe will bring this action.

If you were to read every word these theorists ever wrote on authoritarians, and then try to design a hypothetical candidate to match their predictions of what would appeal to authoritarian voters, the result would look a lot like Donald Trump.

But political scientists say this theory explains much more than just Donald Trump, placing him within larger trends in American politics: polarization, the rightward shift of the Republican Party, and the rise within that party of a dissident faction challenging GOP orthodoxies and upending American politics.

More than that, authoritarianism reveals the connections between several seemingly disparate stories about American politics. And it suggest that a combination of demographic, economic, and political forces, by awakening this authoritarian class of voters that has coalesced around Trump, have created what is essentially a new political party within the GOP  a phenomenon that broke into public view with the 2016 election but will persist long after it has ended.

II. The discovery: how a niche subfield of political science suddenly became some of the most relevant research in American politics

This study of authoritarianism began shortly after World War II, as political scientists and psychologists in the US and Europe tried to figure out how the Nazis had managed to win such wide public support for such an extreme and hateful ideology.

That was a worthy field of study, but the early work wasn't particularly rigorous by today's standards. The critical theorist Theodor Adorno, for instance, developed what he called the ""F-scale,"" which sought to measure ""fascist"" tendencies. The test wasn't accurate. Sophisticated respondents would quickly discover what the ""right"" answers were and game the test. And there was no proof that the personality type it purportedly measured actually supported fascism.

More than that, this early research seemed to assume that a certain subset of people were inherently evil or dangerous  an idea that Hetherington and Weiler say is simplistic and wrong, and that they resist in their work. (They acknowledge the label ""authoritarians"" doesn't do much to dispel this, but their efforts to replace it with a less pejorative-sounding term were unsuccessful.)

If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump's ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics?
But the real problem for researchers was that even if there really were such a thing as an authoritarian psychological profile, how do you measure it? How do you interrogate authoritarian tendencies, which can sometimes be latent? How do you get honest answers on questions that can be sensitive and highly politicized?

As Hetherington explained to me, ""There are certain things that you just can't ask people directly. You can't ask people, 'Do you not like black people?' You can't ask people if they're bigots.""

For a long time, no one had a solution for this, and the field of study languished.

Then in the early 1990s, a political scientist named Stanley Feldman changed everything. Feldman, a professor at SUNY Stonybrook, believed authoritarianism could be an important factor in American politics in ways that had nothing to do with fascism, but that it could only reliably be measured by unlinking it from specific political preferences.

He realized that if authoritarianism were a personality profile rather than just a political preference, he could get respondents to reveal these tendencies by asking questions about a topic that seemed much less controversial. He settled on something so banal it seems almost laughable: parenting goals.

Feldman developed what has since become widely accepted as the definitive measurement of authoritarianism: four simple questions that appear to ask about parenting but are in fact designed to reveal how highly the respondent values hierarchy, order, and conformity over other values.

Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: independence or respect for elders?
Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: obedience or self-reliance?
Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: to be considerate or to be well-behaved?
Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: curiosity or good manners?
Feldman's test proved to be very reliable. There was now a way to identify people who fit the authoritarian profile, by prizing order and conformity, for example, and desiring the imposition of those values.

In 1992, Feldman convinced the National Election Study, a large survey of American voters conducted in each national election year, to include his four authoritarianism questions. Ever since, political scientists who study authoritarianism have accumulated a wealth of data on who exhibits those tendencies and on how they align with everything from demographic profiles to policy preferences.

What they found was impossible to ignore  and is only just beginning to reshape our understanding of the American electorate.

III. How authoritarianism works

In the early 2000s, as researchers began to make use of the NES data to understand how authoritarianism affected US politics, their work revealed three insights that help explain not just the rise of Trump, but seemingly a half-century of American political dynamics.

The first was Hetherington and Weiler's insight into partisan polarization. In the 1960s, the Republican Party had reinvented itself as the party of law, order, and traditional values  a position that naturally appealed to order- and tradition-focused authoritarians. Over the decades that followed, authoritarians increasingly gravitated toward the GOP, where their concentration gave them more and more influence over time.

The second was Stenner's theory of ""activation."" In an influential 2005 book called The Authoritarian Dynamic, Stenner argued that many authoritarians might be latent  that they might not necessarily support authoritarian leaders or policies until their authoritarianism had been ""activated.""

The social threat theory helps explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same-sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them
This activation could come from feeling threatened by social changes such as evolving social norms or increasing diversity, or any other change that they believe will profoundly alter the social order they want to protect. In response, previously more moderate individuals would come to support leaders and policies we might now call Trump-esque.

Other researchers, like Hetherington, take a slightly different view. They believe that authoritarians aren't ""activated""  they've always held their authoritarian preferences  but that they only come to express those preferences once they feel threatened by social change or some kind of threat from outsiders.

But both schools of thought agree on the basic causality of authoritarianism. People do not support extreme policies and strongman leaders just out of an affirmative desire for authoritarianism, but rather as a response to experiencing certain kinds of threats.

The third insight came from Hetherington and American University professor Elizabeth Suhay, who found that when non-authoritarians feel sufficiently scared, they also start to behave, politically, like authoritarians.

But Hetherington and Suhay found a distinction between physical threats such as terrorism, which could lead non-authoritarians to behave like authoritarians, and more abstract social threats, such as eroding social norms or demographic changes, which do not have that effect. That distinction would turn out to be important, but it also meant that in times when many Americans perceived imminent physical threats, the population of authoritarians could seem to swell rapidly.

Together, those three insights added up to one terrifying theory: that if social change and physical threats coincided at the same time, it could awaken a potentially enormous population of American authoritarians, who would demand a strongman leader and the extreme policies necessary, in their view, to meet the rising threats.

This theory would seem to predict the rise of an American political constituency that looks an awful lot like the support base that has emerged, seemingly out of nowhere, to propel Donald Trump from sideshow loser of the 2012 GOP primary to runaway frontrunner in 2016.

Beyond being almost alarmingly prescient, this theory speaks to an oft-stated concern about Trump: that what's scariest is not the candidate, but rather the extent and fervor of his support.

And it raises a question: If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump's ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics? And what effect could it have even after the 2016 race has ended?

IV. What can authoritarianism explain?

In early February, shortly after Trump finished second in the Iowa caucus and ended any doubts about his support, I began talking to Feldman, Hetherington, and MacWilliams to try to answer these questions.

MacWilliams had already demonstrated a link between authoritarianism and support for Trump. But we wanted to know how else authoritarianism was playing out in American life, from policy positions to party politics to social issues, and what it might mean for America's future.

It was time to call Kyle Dropp. Dropp is a political scientist and pollster whom one of my colleagues described as ""the Doogie Howser of polling."" He does indeed appear jarringly young for a Dartmouth professor. But he is also the co-founder of a media and polling company, Morning Consult, that had worked with Vox on several other projects.

When we approached Morning Consult, Dropp and his colleagues were excited. Dropp was familiar with Hetherington's work and the authoritarianism measure, he said, and was instantly intrigued by how we could test its relevance to the election. Hetherington and the other political scientists were, in turn, eager to more fully explore the theories that had suddenly become much more relevant.

Non-authoritarians who were sufficiently frightened of threats like terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians
We put together five sets of questions. The first set, of course, was the test for authoritarianism that Feldman had developed. This would allow us to measure how authoritarianism coincided or didn't with our other sets of questions.

The second set asked standard election-season questions on preferred candidates and party affiliation.

The third set tested voters' fears of a series of physical threats, ranging from ISIS and Russia to viruses and car accidents.

The fourth set tested policy preferences, in an attempt to see how authoritarianism might lead voters to support particular policies.

If the research were right, then we'd expect people who scored highly on authoritarianism to express outsize fear of ""outsider"" threats such as ISIS or foreign governments versus other threats. We also expected that non-authoritarians who expressed high levels of fear would be more likely to support Trump. This would speak to physical fears as triggering a kind of authoritarian upsurge, which would in turn lead to Trump support.

We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election
The final set of questions was intended to test fear of social change. We asked people to rate a series of social changes  both actual and hypothetical  on a scale of ""very good"" to ""very bad"" for the country. These included same-sex marriage, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and American Muslims building more mosques in US cities.

If the theory about social change provoking stress amongst authoritarians turned out to be correct, then authoritarians would be more likely to rate the changes as bad for the country.

In the aggregate, we were hoping to do a few things. We wanted to understand who these people are, in simple demographic terms, and to test the basic hypotheses about how authoritarianism, in theory, is supposed to work. We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election: Were they driving certain policy positions, for example?

We wanted to better understand the larger forces that had suddenly made authoritarians so numerous and so extreme  was it migration, terrorism, perhaps the decline of working-class whites? And maybe most of all, we wanted to develop some theories about what the rise of American authoritarianism meant for the future of polarization between the parties as well as a Republican Party that had become both more extreme and internally divided.

About 10 days later, shortly after Trump won the New Hampshire primary, the poll went into the field. In less than two weeks, we had our results.

V. How the GOP became the party of authoritarians

The first thing that jumped out from the data on authoritarians is just how many there are. Our results found that 44 percent of white respondents nationwide scored as ""high"" or ""very high"" authoritarians, with 19 percent as ""very high."" That's actually not unusual, and lines up with previous national surveys that found that the authoritarian disposition is far from rare1.

The key thing to understand is that authoritarianism is often latent; people in this 44 percent only vote or otherwise act as authoritarians once triggered by some perceived threat, physical or social. But that latency is part of how, over the past few decades, authoritarians have quietly become a powerful political constituency without anyone realizing it.

Today, according to our survey, authoritarians skew heavily Republican. More than 65 percent of people who scored highest on the authoritarianism questions were GOP voters. More than 55 percent of surveyed Republicans scored as ""high"" or ""very high"" authoritarians.

And at the other end of the scale, that pattern reversed. People whose scores were most non-authoritarian  meaning they always chose the non-authoritarian parenting answer  were almost 75 percent Democrats.

But this hasn't always been the case. According to Hetherington and Weiler's research, this is not a story about how Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Venus. It's a story of polarization that increased over time.

They trace the trend to the 1960s, when the Republican Party shifted electoral strategies to try to win disaffected Southern Democrats, in part by speaking to fears of changing social norms  for example, the racial hierarchies upset by civil rights. The GOP also embraced a ""law and order"" platform with a heavily racial appeal to white voters who were concerned about race riots.

This positioned the GOP as the party of traditional values and social structures  a role that it has maintained ever since. That promise to stave off social change and, if necessary, to impose order happened to speak powerfully to voters with authoritarian inclinations.

Democrats, by contrast, have positioned themselves as the party of civil rights, equality, and social progress  in other words, as the party of social change, a position that not only fails to attract but actively repels change-averse authoritarians.

Over the next several decades, Hetherington explained to me, this led authoritarians to naturally ""sort"" themselves into the Republican Party.

That matters, because as more authoritarians sort themselves into the GOP, they have more influence over its policies and candidates. It is not for nothing that our poll found that more than half of the Republican respondents score as authoritarian.

Perhaps more importantly, the party has less and less ability to ignore authoritarians' voting preferences  even if those preferences clash with the mainstream party establishment.

VI. Trump, authoritarians, and fear
  
Based on our data, Morning Consult data scientist Adam Petrihos said that ""among Republicans, very high/high authoritarianism is very predictive of support for Trump."" Trump has 42 percent support among Republicans but, according to our survey, a full 52 percent support among very high authoritarians.

Authoritarianism was the best single predictor of support for Trump, although having a high school education also came close. And as Hetherington noted after reviewing our results, the relationship between authoritarianism and Trump support remained robust, even after controlling for education level and gender.

Trump support was much lower among Republicans who scored low on authoritarianism: only 38 percent.

But that's still awfully high. So what could explain Trump's support among non-authoritarians?

I suspected the answer might lie at least partly in Hetherington and Suhay's research on how fear affects non-authoritarian voters, so I called them to discuss the data. Hetherington crunched some numbers on physical threats and noticed two things.

The first was that authoritarians tend to fear very specific kinds of physical threats.


Authoritarians, we found in our survey, tend to most fear threats that come from abroad, such as ISIS or Russia or Iran. These are threats, the researchers point out, to which people can put a face; a scary terrorist or an Iranian ayatollah. Non-authoritarians were much less afraid of those threats. For instance, 73 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians believed that terrorist organizations like ISIS posed a ""very high risk"" to them, but only 45 percent of very low-scoring authoritarians did. Domestic threats like car accidents, by contrast, were much less frightening to authoritarians.

But Hetherington also noticed something else: A subgroup of non-authoritarians were very afraid of threats like Iran or ISIS. And the more fear of these threats they expressed, the more likely they were to support Trump.

  
This seemed to confirm his and Suhay's theory: that non-authoritarians who are sufficiently frightened of physical threats such as terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians.

That's important, because for years now, Republican politicians and Republican-leaning media such as Fox News have been telling viewers nonstop that the world is a terrifying place and that President Obama isn't doing enough to keep Americans safe.

There are a variety of political and media incentives for why this happens. But the point is that, as a result, Republican voters have been continually exposed to messages warning of physical dangers. As the perception of physical threat has risen, this fear appears to have led a number of non-authoritarians to vote like authoritarians  to support Trump.

An irony of this primary is that the Republican establishment has tried to stop Trump by, among other things, co-opting his message. But when establishment candidates such as Marco Rubio try to match Trump's rhetoric on ISIS or on American Muslims, they may end up deepening the fear that can only lead voters back to Trump.

VII. Is America's changing social landscape ""activating"" authoritarianism?
But the research on authoritarianism suggests it's not just physical threats driving all this. There should be another kind of threat  larger, slower, less obvious, but potentially even more powerful  pushing authoritarians to these extremes: the threat of social change.

This could come in the form of evolving social norms, such as the erosion of traditional gender roles or evolving standards in how to discuss sexual orientation. It could come in the form of rising diversity, whether that means demographic changes from immigration or merely changes in the colors of the faces on TV. Or it could be any changes, political or economic, that disrupt social hierarchies.

What these changes have in common is that, to authoritarians, they threaten to take away the status quo as they know it  familiar, orderly, secure  and replace it with something that feels scary because it is different and destabilizing, but also sometimes because it upends their own place in society. According to the literature, authoritarians will seek, in response, a strong leader who promises to suppress the scary changes, if necessary by force, and to preserve the status quo.

This is why, in our survey, we wanted to study the degree to which authoritarians versus non-authoritarians expressed a fear of social change  and whether this, as expected, led them to desire heavy-handed responses.

  
Our results seemed to confirm this: Authoritarians were significantly more likely to rate almost all of the actual and hypothetical social issues we asked about as ""bad"" or ""very bad"" for the country.

For instance, our results suggested that an astonishing 44 percent of authoritarians believe same-sex marriage is harmful to the country. Twenty-eight percent rated same-sex marriage as ""very bad"" for America, and another 16 percent said that its ""bad."" Only about 35 percent of high-scoring authoritarians said same-sex marriage was ""good"" or ""very good"" for the country.

Tellingly, non-authoritarians' responses skewed in the opposite direction. Non-authoritarians tended to rate same-sex marriage as ""good"" or ""very good"" for the country.

The fact that authoritarians and non-authoritarians split over something as seemingly personal and nonthreatening as same-sex marriage is crucial for understanding how authoritarianism can be triggered by even a social change as minor as expanding marriage rights.

We also asked respondents to rate whether Muslims building more mosques in American cities was a good thing. This was intended to test respondents' comfort level with sharing their communities with Muslims  an issue that has been particularly contentious this primary election.

  
A whopping 56.5 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians said it was either ""bad"" or ""very bad"" for the country when Muslims built more mosques. Only 14 percent of that group said more mosques would be ""good"" or ""very good.""

The literature on authoritarianism suggests this is not just simple Islamophobia, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon wherein authoritarians feel threatened by people they identify as ""outsiders"" and by the possibility of changes to the status quo makeup of their communities.

This would help explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same-sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them. What these seemingly disparate groups have in common is the perceived threat they pose to the status quo order, which authoritarians experience as a threat to themselves.

And America is at a point when the status quo social order is changing rapidly; when several social changes are converging. And they are converging especially on working-class white people.

It is conventional wisdom to ascribe the rise of first the Tea Party right and now Trump to the notion that working-class white Americans are angry.

Indeed they are, but this data helps explain that they are also under certain demographic and economic pressures that, according to this research, are highly likely to trigger authoritarianism  and thus suggests there is something a little more complex going on than simple ""anger"" that helps explain their gravitation toward extreme political responses.

Working-class communities have come under tremendous economic strain since the recession. And white people are also facing the loss of the privileged position that they previously were able to take for granted. Whites are now projected to become a minority group over the next few decades, owing to migration and other factors. The president is a black man, and nonwhite faces are growing more common in popular culture. Nonwhite groups are raising increasingly prominent political demands, and often those demands coincide with issues such as policing that also speak to authoritarian concerns.

Some of these factors might be considered more or less legitimately threatening than others  the loss of working-class jobs in this country is a real and important issue, no matter how one feels about fading white privilege  but that is not the point.

The point, rather, is that the increasingly important political phenomenon we identify as right-wing populism, or white working-class populism, seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed.

That is not to dismiss white working-class concerns as invalid because they might be expressed by authoritarians or through authoritarian politics, but rather to better understand why this is happening  and why it's having such a profound and extreme effect on American politics.

Have we misunderstood hard-line social conservatism all along?
Most of the other social-threat questions followed a similar pattern2. On its surface, this might seem to suggest that authoritarianism is just a proxy for especially hard-line manifestations of social conservatism. But when examined more carefully, it suggests something more interesting about the nature of social conservatism itself.

For liberals, it may be easy to conclude that opposition to things like same-sex marriage, immigration, and diversity is rooted in bigotry against those groups  that it's the manifestation of specific homophobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.

But the results of the Vox/Morning Consult poll, along with prior research on authoritarianism, suggests there might be something else going on.

There is no particular reason, after all, why parenting goals should coincide with animus against specific groups. We weren't asking questions about whether it was important for children to respect people of different races, but about whether they should respect authority and rules generally. So why do they coincide so heavily?

What might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner's theory of ""activation""
What is most likely, Hetherington suggested, is that authoritarians are much more susceptible to messages that tell them to fear a specific ""other""  whether or not they have a preexisting animus against that group. Those fears would therefore change over time as events made different groups seem more or less threatening.

It all depends, he said, on whether a particular group of people has been made into an outgroup or not  whether they had been identified as a dangerous other.

Since September 2001, some media outlets and politicians have painted Muslims as the other and as dangerous to America. Authoritarians, by nature, are more susceptible to these messages, and thus more likely to come to oppose the presence of mosques in their communities.

When told to fear a particular outgroup, Hetherington said, ""On average people who score low in authoritarianism will be like, 'Im not that worried about that,' while people who score high in authoritarianism will be like, 'Oh, my god! Im worried about that, because the world is a dangerous place.'""

In other words, what might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner's theory of ""activation"": that authoritarians are unusually susceptible to messages about the ways outsiders and social changes threaten America, and so lash out at groups that are identified as objects of concern at that given moment.

That's not to say that such an attitude is in some way better than simple racism or xenophobia  it is still dangerous and damaging, especially if it empowers frightening demagogues like Donald Trump.

Perhaps more to the point, it helps explain how Trump's supporters have come to so quickly embrace such extreme policies targeting these outgroups: mass deportation of millions of people, a ban on foreign Muslims visiting the US. When you think about those policy preferences as driven by authoritarianism, in which social threats are perceived as especially dangerous and as demanding extreme responses, rather than the sudden emergence of specific bigotries, this starts to make a lot more sense.

VIII. What authoritarians want
From our parenting questions, we learned who the GOP authoritarians are. From our questions about threats and social change, we learned what's motivating them. But the final set of questions, on policy preferences, might be the most important of all: So what? What do authoritarians actually want?

The responses to our policy questions showed that authoritarians have their own set of policy preferences, distinct from GOP orthodoxy. And those preferences mean that, in real and important ways, authoritarians are their own distinct constituency: effectively a new political party within the GOP.

What stands out from the results, Feldman wrote after reviewing our data, is that authoritarians ""are most willing to want to use force, to crack down on immigration, and limit civil liberties.""

This ""action side"" of authoritarianism, he believed, was the key thing that distinguished Trump supporters from supporters of other GOP candidates. ""The willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats  that is most clear among Trump supporters.""

Authoritarians generally and Trump voters specifically, we found, were highly likely to support five policies:

Using military force over diplomacy against countries that threaten the United States
Changing the Constitution to bar citizenship for children of illegal immigrants
Imposing extra airport checks on passengers who appear to be of Middle Eastern descent in order to curb terrorism
Requiring all citizens to carry a national ID card at all times to show to a police officer on request, to curb terrorism
Allowing the federal government to scan all phone calls for calls to any number linked to terrorism
What these policies share in common is an outsize fear of threats, physical and social, and, more than that, a desire to meet those threats with severe government action  with policies that are authoritarian not just in style but in actuality. The scale of the desired response is, in some ways, what most distinguishes authoritarians from the rest of the GOP.

""Many Republicans seem to be threatened by terrorism, violence, and cultural diversity, but that's not unique to Trump supporters,"" Feldman told me.

""It seems to be the action side of authoritarianism  the willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats  that is most clear among Trump supporters,"" he added.

If Trump loses the election, that won't remove the threats and social changes that trigger the ""action side"" of authoritarianism
This helps explain why the GOP has had such a hard time co-opting Trump's supporters, even though those supporters' immediate policy concerns, such as limiting immigration or protecting national security, line up with party orthodoxy. The real divide is over how far to go in responding. And the party establishment is simply unwilling to call for such explicitly authoritarian policies.

Just as striking is what was missing from authoritarians' concerns. There was no clear correlation between authoritarianism and support for tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 per year, for example. And the same was true of support for international trade agreements.

These are both issues associated with mainstream GOP economic policies. All groups opposed the tax cuts, and support for trade agreements was evenly lukewarm across all degrees of authoritarianism. So there is no real divide on these issues.

But there is one more factor that our data couldn't capture but is nevertheless important: Trump's style.

Trump's specific policies aren't the thing that most sets him apart from the rest of the field of GOP candidates. Rather, it's his rhetoric and style. The way he reduces everything to black-and-white extremes of strong versus weak, greatest versus worst. His simple, direct promises that he can solve problems that other politicians are too weak to manage.

And, perhaps most importantly, his willingness to flout all the conventions of civilized discourse when it comes to the minority groups that authoritarians find so threatening. That's why it's a benefit rather than a liability for Trump when he says Mexicans are rapists or speaks gleefully of massacring Muslims with pig-blood-tainted bullets: He is sending a signal to his authoritarian supporters that he won't let ""political correctness"" hold him back from attacking the outgroups they fear.

This, Feldman explained to me, is ""classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive.""

IX. How authoritarians will change the GOP  and American politics

To my surprise, the most compelling conclusion to come out of our polling data wasn't about Trump at all.

Rather, it was that authoritarians, as a growing presence in the GOP, are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump  and will persist as a force in American politics regardless of the fate of his candidacy.

If Trump loses the election, that will not remove the threats and social changes that trigger the ""action side"" of authoritarianism. The authoritarians will still be there. They will still look for candidates who will give them the strong, punitive leadership they desire.

And that means Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics, with potentially profound implications for the country.

It would also mean more problems for the GOP. This election is already showing that the party establishment abhors Trump and all he stands for  his showy demagoguery, his disregard for core conservative economic values, his divisiveness.

We may now have a de facto three-party system: the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians
But while the party may try to match Trump's authoritarian rhetoric, and its candidates may grudgingly embrace some of his harsher policies toward immigrants or Muslims, in the end a mainstream political party cannot fully commit to extreme authoritarian action the way Trump can.

That will be a problem for the party. Just look at where the Tea Party has left the Republican establishment. The Tea Party delivered the House to the GOP in 2010, but ultimately left the party in an unresolved civil war. Tea Party candidates have challenged moderates and centrists, leaving the GOP caucus divided and chaotic.

Now a similar divide is playing out at the presidential level, with results that are even more destructive for the Republican Party. Authoritarians may be a slight majority within the GOP, and thus able to force their will within the party, but they are too few and their views too unpopular to win a national election on their own.

And so the rise of authoritarianism as a force within American politics means we may now have a de facto three-party system: the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians.

And although the latter two groups are presently forced into an awkward coalition, the GOP establishment has demonstrated a complete inability to regain control over the renegade authoritarians, and the authoritarians are actively opposed to the establishment's centrist goals and uninterested in its economic platform.

Over time, this will have significant political consequences for the Republican Party. It will become more difficult for Republican candidates to win the presidency because the candidates who can win the nomination by appealing to authoritarian primary voters will struggle to court mainstream voters in the general election. They will have less trouble with local and congressional elections, but that might just mean more legislative gridlock as the GOP caucus struggles to balance the demands of authoritarian and mainstream legislators. The authoritarian base will drag the party further to the right on social issues, and will simultaneously erode support for traditionally conservative economic policies.

And in the meantime, the forces activating American authoritarians seem likely to only grow stronger. Norms around gender, sexuality, and race will continue evolving. Movements like Black Lives Matter will continue chipping away at the country's legacy of institutionalized discrimination, pursuing the kind of social change and reordering of society that authoritarians find so threatening.

The chaos in the Middle East, which allows groups like ISIS to flourish and sends millions of refugees spilling into other countries, shows no sign of improving. Longer term, if current demographic trends continue, white Americans will cease to be a majority over the coming decades.

In the long run, this could mean a GOP that is even more hard-line on immigration and on policing, that is more outspoken about fearing Muslims and other minority groups, but also takes a softer line on traditional party economic issues like tax cuts. It will be a GOP that continues to perform well in congressional and local elections, but whose divisions leave the party caucus divided to the point of barely functioning, and perhaps eventually unable to win the White House.

For decades, the Republican Party has been winning over authoritarians by implicitly promising to stand firm against the tide of social change, and to be the party of force and power rather than the party of negotiation and compromise. But now it may be discovering that its strategy has worked too well  and threatens to tear the party apart.",R
"The real Clinton email scandal is that a bullshit story has dominated the campaign
","Some time ago, Hillary Clinton and her advisers decided that the best course of action was to apologize for having used a personal email address to conduct government business while serving as secretary of state. Clinton herself was, clearly, not really all that remorseful about this, and it showed in her early efforts to address it. Eventually aides prevailed upon her to express a greater degree of regret, which they hoped would lay the issue to rest.

It did not. Instead, email-related talk has dogged Clinton throughout the election and it has influenced public perceptions of her in an overwhelmingly negative way. July polling showed 56 percent of Americans believed Clinton broke the law by relying on a personal email address with another 36 percent piling on to say the episode showed bad judgments albeit not criminality.

Because Clinton herself apologized for it and because it does not appear to be in any way important, Clinton allies, surrogates, and co-partisans have largely not familiarized themselves with the details of the matter, instead saying vaguely that it was an error of judgment and she apologized and America has bigger fish to fry.

This has had the effect of further inscribing and reinscribing the notion that Clinton did something wrong, meaning that every bit of micro-news that puts the scandal back on cable amounts to reminding people of something bad that Clinton did. In total, network newscasts have, remarkably, dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clintons emails than to all policy issues combined.

This is unfortunate because emailgate, like so many Clinton pseudo-scandals before it, is bullshit. The real scandal here is the way a story that was at best of modest significance came to dominate the US presidential election  overwhelming stories of much more importance, giving the American people a completely skewed impression of one of the two nominees, and creating space for the FBI to intervene in the election in favor of its apparently preferred candidate in a dangerous way.

Why Hillary Clinton used a personal email account
When Hillary Clinton took office as secretary of state, she, like most people, already had a personal email account. Like most people who started a federal job in 2009, she was also disheartened to learn that the then-current state of federal IT departments was such that she could not connect her personal smartphone to a State Department email address. If she wanted ready access to both her email accounts, she would need to carry two smartphones.

As any reporter in Washington knows, this indignity was in fact visited upon a huge number of DC denizens for many years. Everyone working in government felt that this was kinda bullshit, but nobody could really do anything about it. (Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts has opined that carrying two phones could be reasonable grounds to suspect someone is a drug dealer.)

Clinton decided to do something about it. Namely, she told her top aides to just email her at her personal address so she could keep using whichever devices she wanted. This violated an internal State Department policy directive, known as a Foreign Affairs Manual, which stated that while it was okay to use personal digital devices to do work occasionally, normal day-to-day operations should be conducted on standard State Department equipment. Clinton chose to ignore this guideline and because she was the boss nobody could stop her. Career foreign service officers and other State personnel have every right to be peeved that Clinton opted out of an annoying policy rather than fixing the underlying issue, but its hardly a matter of overwhelming public concern.

And, indeed, it turns out Colin Powell also used a private email address for routine work. Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright didnt use email, and back before Albright only weird nerds even knew what email was. So at the time Clinton took office, only one previous secretary of state had ever faced the question of what email account to use, and he reached the exact same conclusion Clinton did  just use your personal email address.

Why Hillary used a private email server
When Hillary tried the eminently sensible I was following precedent defense, Politifact dinged her answer as mostly false on the grounds that while Powell did use a personal email account, he didnt use a private email server.

This distinction has attracted a lot of attention. And its proven politically damaging  because while lots of people maintain two email addresses and sometimes do work stuff on their personal email, very few Americans use a private email server as opposed to relying on a commercial email service. But legally speaking, this is completely irrelevant. As the State Department inspector general concluded in its report on Clintons conduct, the guideline Clinton violated was a principle that normal day-to-day operations should be conducted on an authorized Automated Information System.

Using a private server violates that rule, but so would using a Gmail address or simply checking your State.gov email address from your personal laptop rather than a Department-issue one.

But while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant, its certainly unusual. And it leaves people wondering: Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private server?

Clinton, as you may have heard, is married to former president Bill Clinton, who stepped down from office in January of 2001. Clinton was in the White House throughout the 1990s when the rest of us were being bombarded with AOL signup CD-ROMs, so he didnt have a personal email when he left. Gmail didnt exist back then, and his new job was, in effect, running a Bill Clinton startup. He launched a charitable foundation, he established his presidential library, and he made big bucks on speaking tours. He had a staff and he needed IT infrastructure and support. So he paid a guy to set up an email server that he could use.

Hillary Clinton  who is, again, his wife  also set herself up with an account on the same server. This is a bit unusual, but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual. What its not is suspicious.

The private server was not a transparency dodge
Its become a bit of an article of faith among journalists frustrated with public officials constant FOIA-dodging that this is all obviously dissimulation and Clinton was really trying to evade the Freedom of Information Act.

Many people, for example, point to the fact that Clinton would routinely travel with multiple digital devices as debunking her supposed convenience argument. But this is silly. Ive been known to travel with an iPhone, an iPad, a Kindle, and a laptop all at once. That doesnt mean needing to carry two separate iPhones (one to check my work email and one to check my personal email) wouldnt be inconvenient. After all, what if I was replying to a work email while a text came in to my personal phone and I wanted to check it.

Id be left juggling phones and looking like an idiot, exactly how federal employees tended to look in the heyday of the double-fisting phones era.

I would not want to do that. Colin Powell did not want to do that. Hillary Clinton did not want to do that. Because that would be terrible.

By contrast, its a terrible solution to a desire to avoid having your emails disclosed to the public via FOIA. One way you can tell its a terrible solution is that Hillary Clintons work emails have been disclosed to the public. You can read them right here.

The specific timeline is that the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested Clintons emails in the summer of 2014, at which point the relevant State Department personnel realized they did not have the emails because Clinton had been using her personal address. State asked Clinton for the emails, and she handed them over later that year. It was only in March of 2015 that the New York Times broke the story of Clintons personal email account in a scoop by Michael Schmidt (the server was reported a few days later by the AP)*, which reported that the emails had been handed over to the State Department two months ago.

This is fairly clearly not an optimal approach to government record-keeping, as Thomas Blanton of the National Security Archive at George Washington University told Schmidt at the time:

Its a shame it didnt take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have. Someone in the State Department deserves credit for taking the initiative to ask for the records back. Most of the time it takes the threat of litigation and embarrassment.
According to the Inspector Generals report, Clinton should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary.

There are two possible interpretations here. One is that Clinton hatched the private email account plan as an elaborate dodge of federal record-keeping laws, but then months before the public became aware of the servers existence complied with requests to turn them over. The other is that the federal records rule on the book was antiquated and a bit absurd, requiring officials to turn over paper copies of emails for no good reason, and simply got ignored out of sloppiness.

But she deleted 33,000 emails!
Suspicion at this point is then supposed to focus on the fact that she had her lawyers delete more than 30,000 emails from her server.

After Hillary left office, the State Department told her she had to turn all her work-related emails over to them, so she tasked a legal team with determining which emails were work emails and which were not. She turned the work emails over because thats what she was legally required to do. She deleted the others, presumably because she did not want Trey Gowdy and Jason Chaffetz to rummage through her inbox leaking whatever they happened to find amusing to area journalists.

Now, is it possible that Clintons legal team simply decided to entirely disregard the law and delete work-related emails?

In some sense, sure. But theres no evidence that this happened. Generally speaking, in life we assume it would be moderately difficult to hire a well-known law firm to destroy evidence for you without someone deciding to do the right thing and squeal.

Besides which, it would be almost comically easy to catch Clinton in the act of systematically destroying relevant emails. The vast majority of the work-related email correspondence of an incumbent secretary of state, after all, is going to be correspondence with other government employees. Maybe she shoots a note to the Pentagon about Benghazi, or circulates ideas for a speech draft with her communications team. Any message like that, by definition, would exist on a government server as well as on her private one. This means it would be fully accessible via FOIA and also means that if Clintons copy were found to not be in the pile of emails she turned over, shed be caught red handed.

The available FOIA workarounds are available to everyone
Now whats true is that Clinton could, in theory, have conducted work-related email conversations using another persons personal email address.

She could, for instance, have emailed Jake Sullivan on his Gmail address then deleted the email from her private server. Wed be in the dark and shed get away with it.

The key thing to note here, however, is that the availability of this option has nothing to do with Clintons decision to use a personal account as her exclusive account and also has nothing to do with her decision to host her personal email on a private server.

At any given time, any federal employee can use her personal account to email any other federal employee at his personal account. If they receive a Freedom of Information Act request, they are legally obligated to hand that correspondence over. But in a practical sense, if they want to break the law they can probably get away with it. And as Ezra Klein has noted, there are a lot of workarounds here:

As every reporter knows, when official sources want to tell you something particularly delicate, they email you from a personal account  or, much more often, they call.

A lot of my reporting happens by email. But virtually none of my reporting with the White House happens by email. There, emails for clarification, or comment, quickly lead to phone calls. The reason  unsaid but obvious  is that phone calls don't leave an official record. White House officials can talk freely on the phone in a way they can't over email.

Similarly, the White House keeps a visitor's log. If you make an appointment to meet with someone, your entrance and point of contact are recorded for posterity and searchable online. When someone who shouldn't be meeting with you wants to meet with you, they tend to suggest an off-site location: a restaurant downtown, or a nearby coffee shop. Peet's Coffee doesn't keep a list of everyone who walks in or out.
We do not, however, generally treat all federal employees as having a massive ethical cloud over their heads just because they could probably use this workaround to break the law. There is zero reason to apply heightened scrutiny to Clinton just because she also could break the law.

Besides which, when you are secretary of state there is a much simpler and easier way to mask your correspondence: classification.

Here, for example, is an email Sullivan sent to Clinton on June 4, 2011, that was duly handed over to the State Department and made available by the FOIA office:

 
Im not saying the contents of that message dont deserve to be redacted for security purposes. The fact is that I have no idea. But the reality is the American national security state is really, really good at using official channels to avoid disclosure of information. Nobody needs a private email server to pull that off.

Indeed, the allegation that the server setup was an elaborate con to evade transparency law is doubly ridiculous. On the one hand, a private server would not be necessary to carry it out. (All you need is to have a private email address on the side, which everyone does.) While on the other hand, the exclusive use of a personal email account means that Clintons personal account has come under an exceptional level of security.

The classification thing is a red herring
Its precisely because nothing about the basic setup of the email account was in any way wrong that the investigation ended up focusing on the question of mishandling classified information.

The key point here is that using a State.gov email account would not have changed anything. When US government officials have conversations about classified matters, they are not supposed to use email. They are supposed to use special secure channels.

Nonetheless, mistakes happen in part because classification standards are vague and ever-changing. Technically speaking, forwarding a Washington Post article detailing things revealed by Edward Snowden could constitute an improper discussion of classified matters.

As FBI Director James Comey concluded, no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against Clinton over this matter. Almost all of the relevant statutes require an intent to mishandle classified information in order to bring a prosecution, a standard that Clintons conduct clearly does not meet. Critics have thus chosen to focus on 18 USC  793, a statute that sets a lower gross negligence standard.

However, as Jack Goldsmith, one of the top lawyers in George W. Bushs administration explains, such a prosecution would be entirely novel, and would turn in part on very tricky questions about how email exchanges fit into language written with physical removal of classified information in mind.

Ben Wittes, a veteran legal journalist and Brookings fellow who has spent the past several years specializing in national security law, wrote that Comeys characterization was clearly correct:

For the last several months, people have been asking me what I thought the chances of an indictment were. I have said each time that there is no chance without evidence of bad faith action of some kind. People simply don't get indicted for accidental, non-malicious mishandling of classified material. I have followed leak cases for a very long time, both at the Washington Post and since starting Lawfare. I have never seen a criminal matter proceed without even an allegation of something more than mere mishandling of sensitive information. Hillary Clinton is not above the law, but to indict her on these facts, she'd have to be significantly below the law.
Its true that to a layman the Espionage Acts reference to gross negligence sounds similar to Comeys characterization of Clintons actions as extremely careless. But as Philip Zelikow, a counselor to Condoleezza Rice during the Bush administration and currently the Director of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia explains, they only sound alike unless you do a tiny bit of homework on the history and caselaw of the Statute.

Did Hillary Clinton do something criminal with her emails? Philip Zelikow walks you through. #election2016 @AnnCompton @pastpunditry pic.twitter.com/kS8Z4dq9Qf

 Miller Center (@Miller_Center) November 3, 2016
As the Cato Institutes Julian Sanchez writes, attempting a prosecution for non-malicious mishandling would likely result in the statute being held unconstitutional: the Supreme Courts opinion in Gorin v. United States (1941), which suggests that the Espionage Acts intent requirements are an important feature that save it from unconstitutional vagueness.

This legal analysis is important because it makes it clear that even if the Weiner laptop emails arent simply client-side copies of the exact emails the FBI already has, there is essentially no chance it will change the ultimate verdict. The reason Clinton isnt getting locked up is that there was no malign intent. Finding another email with classified information on it wont change that conclusion.

A bullshit scandal amidst a serious election
Network newscasts have, remarkably, dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clintons emails than to all policy issues combined.

Cable news has been, if anything, worse, and many prestige outlets have joined the pileup. One malign result of obsessive email coverage is that the public is left totally unaware of the policy stakes in the election. Another is that the constant vague recitations of the phrase Clinton email scandal have firmly implanted the notion that there is something scandalous about anything involving Hillary Clinton and email, including her campaign manager getting hacked or the revelation that one of her aides sometimes checked mail on her husbands computer.

But none of this is true. Clinton broke no laws according to the FBI itself. Her setup gave her no power to evade federal transparency laws beyond what anyone who has a personal email account of any kind has. Her stated explanation for her conduct is entirely believable, fits the facts perfectly, and is entirely plausible to anyone who doesn't simply start with the assumption that she's guilty of something.

Given Powells conduct, Clinton wasn't even breaking with an informal precedent. The very worst you can say is that, faced with an annoying government IT policy, she used her stature to find a personal workaround rather than a systemic fix that would work for everyone. To spend so much time on such a trivial matter would be absurd in a city council race, much less a presidential election. To do so in circumstances when it advances the electoral prospects of a rival who has shattered all precedents in terms of lacking transparency or basic honesty is infinitely more scandalous than anything related to the server itself.",R
"""It's Official """"Bernie Sanders Is Staying In The Race And Will Not Concede""""""
","Contrary to the conventional wisdom saying that Bernie Sanders would never have been able to force a contested Democratic convention, Hillary Clinton has less than 2,383 pledged delegates. Thus, Bernie Sanders has recently confirmed his desire to continue, as stated by Time:

Bernie Sanders Vows to Continue Political Revolution in New York

But that did not stop the Vermont Senator from defiantly promising to continue the political revolution in a town hall on Thursday, giving a glimpse into his possible future role in the Democratic Party in which he campaigns for progressive candidates across the country.

Speaking with the cadence and conviction of a viable candidate in midtown Manhattan, Sanders again did not concede the nominationand did not endorse his opponent. 
Heres the video of Bernies address from last week and theres also no concession; only a reassurance to millions that his campaign is alive and well.

Therefore, progressive media and pundits should refrain from their gleeful calls to end Bernies campaign. Vermonts Senator is taking his political revolution to Philadelphia and hell continue to run for the presidency.

Why would he stop?

Would you end your presidential campaign if your opponent faced on ongoing FBI criminal investigation?

Bernie Sanders, his campaign, and millions of supporters throughout the nation and world must wait until July 25th, knowing that the FBI will likely disclose its findings of Clintons email investigation before the Democratic convention. POLITICO confirmed the other day that Clintons email investigation is a criminal investigation, as stated by Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan:

Judge links Clinton aides immunity to criminal investigation
A former information technology aide to Hillary Clinton received immunity from the Justice Department in connection with a criminal investigation, a federal judge confirmed Tuesday.

Bryan Pagliano, a computer expert who worked at the State Department while Clinton was secretary of state and was also paid privately by her, was previously reported to have received immunity in connection with statements he gave to the FBI about Clintons private server set-up.

However, there had been no explicit confirmation that the investigationwhich Clinton has repeatedly referred to as a security reviewis actually a criminal probe.

The privacy interests at stake are high because the governments criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in an order issued Tuesday.
When a U.S. District Court Judge confirms your opponent faces a criminal investigation, theres no reason to concede or leave a race for the presidency. Furthermore, Judge Sullivan clearly stated The privacy interests at stake are high because the governments criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential.

Clintons security review days are over, especially since the White House also confirmed the criminal investigation.

But theres no chance of Clinton facing legal consequences, right?

If you know the answer to this question, then tell the world next years winner of the Super Bowl. Also, explain how Clinton circumvents repercussions from the following NBC article titled Hillary Clinton Emails Held Info Beyond Top Secret:

Emails from Hillary Clintons home server contained information classified at levels higher than previously known, including a level meant to protect some of the most sensitive U.S. intelligence, according to a document obtained by NBC News.

In a letter to lawmakers, the intelligence communitys internal watchdog says some of Clintons emails contained information classified Top Secret/Special Access Program, a secrecy designation that includes some of the most closely held U.S. intelligence matters.

Two American intelligence officials tell NBC News these are not the same two emails from Clintons server that have long been reported as containing information deemed Top Secret

While she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, Clinton conducted government business over private email. The arrangement was particularly unusual because the email system relied not on Yahoo or Google but her own server, which she kept in her home in Westchester County, N.Y.
The act of transferring Special Access Program intelligence from secure government networks onto an unsecure private server correlates directly to the Espionage Act. I explain why Clintons Special Access Program intelligence will lead to a Bernie Sanders presidency in the following YouTube segment.

Finally, nothing proves both election fraud and a Bernie Sanders presidency better than Clintons treatment of donors. As stated by CNN last week, Secretary of State Clinton put a Chicago commodities trader on an advisory board regarding nuclear strategy:

Washington (CNN) A major political donor to the Clintons and other top Democrats was selected by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to serve on a key State Department intelligence board in 2011, despite having no clear background in the area, according to emails released this week

In July 2011, Fernando was appointed to a seat on the International Security Advisory Board (ISAB), a panel filled with top-level foreign policy advisers and security experts. Former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart chairs the current panel, which includes retired generals, the former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other high-ranking national security experts

As a member of the top-level group, Fernando was granted a Top Secret security clearance and given access to highly sensitive information.

Fernando, professional State Department staff noted, seemed an awkward selection for the group and spurred concern when an ABC News reporter inquired about him in 2011

An aide, Wade Boese, replied that night that Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills had added Fernandos name to the list of appointees approved by Clinton. The true answer is that S staff (Cheryl Mills) added him. The boards membership preceded me. Raj was not on the list sent to S; he was added at their insistence, Boese wrote. S refers to Clinton, ABC News reported.
Not only did this commodities trader have no background in nuclear strategy, but hes also a Democratic super delegate.

Still believe the system didnt favor Clinton?

From private servers to advisory boards with donors and super delegates, Clintons candidacy is unique in American history. I recently challenged Nate Cohn and Harry Enten (polling experts who failed to predict the rise of Bernie or Trump) on the data pertaining to presidential candidates and FBI criminal investigations. I asked if they could crunch the numbers, and come up with some kind of analysis on whether or not Clinton will become president, based on prior candidates facing FBI criminal probes.

Something tells me that most observers have conveniently ignored the fact Bernies challenger risks serious legal consequences. One can only imagine what pundits would say about Bernie Sanders if he were in Clintons position. Therefore, Bernie has every reason to stay in the race, especially since nobody has ever become nominee alongside an FBI criminal probe.

With Bernie Sanders, theres no risk of scandal or FBI investigations. The talk of Bernie leaving the race must stop, especially since Clintons emails will dominate the media very soon. Bernie Sanders just made it official, and after the FBI discloses its findings, expect Bernie Sanders to become Democratic Nominee. The data driven analysis on candidates with ongoing FBI criminal investigations says Bernie Sanders is still the front-runner in 2016.",R
"Melania Trump's girl-on-girl photos from racy shoot revealed
","Heres the nations would-be first lady  and right beside her, a second lady.

Three years before she met husband Donald Trump, Melania Trump was snapped in a nude frolic with another female model, bombshell photos obtained exclusively by The Post show.

Modal Trigger

The lesbian-themed pics are from a two-day photo shoot in Manhattan in 1995, when Melania Knauss, as she was called, was 25 years old and modeling under the name Melania K.

(Photographer Al de Basseville later told The Post that he misspoke, and the photo session actually took place in 1996 in Manhattan, and appeared in a 1997 issue of the magazine.)

Several were featured in Max Magazine, a now-defunct French mens monthly, more than 20 years ago. Others have never been in print  until now.

The raciest of the photos shows Melania lying nude in a bed as Scandinavian model Emma Eriksson, also naked, embraces her from behind, just below her breasts, which are fully exposed.

In another photo, Eriksson wears sheer stockings, a low-cut bustier, high heels and a long robe  all designed by John Galliano  and raises a whip as if preparing to spank Melania, who pretends to recoil. Melania is more conservatively dressed in a skin-tight gown and high heels.

I always loved women together, because I have been with a lot of women who desired the mnage  trois, said Jarl Ale de Basseville, the French fashion photographer who snapped the pictures.

This is beauty and not porn. I am always shocked by the porn industry because they are destroying the emotion and the essence of purity and simplicity.

Part of the shoot, which de Basseville said was inspired by Renaissance art, took place on the buildings rooftop, said a fashion-industry insider who was present at one of the photo sessions.

Melania behaved like a true professional during one of the nighttime shoots with Eriksson, the source said.

She was charming throughout, said the source, adding that the pics lesbian theme didnt faze her. She was always smiling, with a very pleasant personality and was polite and very well educated.


Al de BassevillePhoto: Al de Basseville
Melania had recently arrived in the city from modeling stints in Paris and Milan at the time. In Gotham, she was booked for mostly commercial work and was later featured in an ad for Camel cigarettes, the source told The Post.

Her sexy photo spread appeared in the January 1996 issue of Max Magazine, whose cover featured a photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford.

In addition to the lesbian-themed shots, de Basseville took several nude pictures of Melania from different angles.

In one of them, Melania pouts at the camera while clad only in stilettos. In another, her back is to the camera, and her arms are raised as if up against a wall.

I think it is important to show the beauty and freedom of the woman, and I am very proud of these pictures because they celebrate Melanias beauty,  de Basseville said.

Asked about the photos, Donald Trump said: Melania was one of the most successful models, and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines. This was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.

The Slovenian-born beauty, now 46, first met Trump at a Fashion Week party in 1998. They married in January 2005 and have one son, Baron, 10.

She has modeled for Sports Illustrated and Vogue among other publications, posing for such top photographers as Helmut Newton and Mario Testino.

"History Tells Us What Will Happen Next With Brexit And Trump
","It seems were entering another of those stupid seasons humans impose on themselves at fairly regular intervals.

My background is archaeology, so also history and anthropology. It leads me to look at big historical patterns. My theory is that most peoples perspective of history is limited to the experience communicated by their parents and grandparents, so 50-100 years. To go beyond that you have to read, study and learn to untangle the propaganda that is inevitable in all telling of history. In a nutshell, at university I would fail a paper if I didnt compare at least two, if not three opposing views on a topic. Taking one telling of events as gospel doesnt wash in the comparative analytical method of research that forms the core of British academia. (I cant speak for other systems, but theyre definitely not all alike in this way.)

So zooming out, we humans have a habit of going into phases of mass destruction, generally self-imposed to some extent or another. This handy list shows all the wars over time. Wars are actually the norm for humans, but every now and then something big comes along. I am interested in the Black Death, which devastated Europe. The opening of Boccaccios Decameron describes Florence in the grips of the Plague. It is as beyond imagination as the Somme, Hiroshima or the Holocaust. I mean, you quite literally cant put yourself there and imagine what it was like. For those in the midst of the Plague, it must have felt like the end of the world.

[Trump is] a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger, creating a cult around himself.
But a defining feature of humans is their resilience. To us now, it seems obvious that we survived the Plague, but to people at the time it must have seemed incredible that their society continued afterwards. Indeed, many takes on the effects of the Black Death are that it had a positive impact in the long term. Well summed up here:

By targeting frail people of all ages, and killing them by the hundreds of thousands within an extremely short period of time, the Black Death might have represented a strong force of natural selection and removed the weakest individuals on a very broad scale within Europe, ...In addition, the Black Death significantly changed the social structure of some European regions. Tragic depopulation created the shortage of working people. This shortage caused wages to rise. Products prices fell too. Consequently, standards of living increased. For instance, people started to consume more food of higher quality.

But for the people living through it, as with the World Wars, Soviet Famines, Holocaust, it must have felt inconceivable that humans could rise up from it. The collapse of the Roman Empire, Black Death, Spanish Inquisition, Thirty Years War, War of the Roses, English Civil War... its a long list. Events of massive destruction from which humanity recovered and move on, often in better shape.

At a local level in time, people think things are fine  then things rapidly spiral out of control until they become unstoppable, and we wreak massive destruction on ourselves. For the people living in the midst of this, it is hard to see happening and hard to understand. To historians later, it all makes sense and we see clearly how one thing led to another. During the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme I was struck that it was a direct outcome of the assassination of an Austrian Arch Duke in Bosnia. I very much doubt anyone at the time thought the killing of a minor European royal would lead to the death of 17 million people.

My point is that this is a cycle. It happens again and again, but as most people only have a 50-100 year historical perspective they dont see that its happening again. As the events that led to the First World War unfolded, there were a few brilliant minds who started to warn that something big was wrong, that the web of treaties across Europe could lead to a war, but they were dismissed as hysterical, mad, or fools, as is always the way, and as people who worry about Putin, Brexit and Trump are dismissed now.

A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if youd listened and thought a bit.
Then after the War to end all Wars, we went and had another one. Again, for a historian it was quite predictable. Lead people to feel they have lost control of their country and destiny, people look for scapegoats, a charismatic leader captures the popular mood, and singles out that scapegoat. He talks in rhetoric that has no detail, and drums up anger and hatred. Soon the masses start to move as one, without any logic driving their actions, and the whole becomes unstoppable.

That was Hitler, but it was also Mussolini, Stalin, Putin, Mugabe and so many more. Mugabe is a very good case in point. He whipped up national anger and hatred towards the land owning white minority (who happened to know how to run farms), and seized their land to redistribute to the people, in a great populist move which in the end unravelled the economy and farming industry and left the people in possession of land, but starving. See also the famines created by the Soviet Union, and the one caused by the Chinese Communists last century in which 20-40 million people died. It seems inconceivable that people could create a situation in which tens of millions of people die without reason, but we do it again and again.

But at the time people dont realize theyre embarking on a route that will lead to a destruction period. They think theyre right, theyre cheered on by jeering angry mobs, their critics are mocked. This cycle, the one we saw for example from the Treaty of Versaille, to the rise of Hitler, to the Second World War, appears to be happening again. But as with before, most people cannot see it because:

1. They are only looking at the present, not the past or future

2. They are only looking immediately around them, not at how events connect globally

3. Most people dont read, think, challenge or hear opposing views

Trump is doing this in America. Those of us with some oversight from history can see it happening. Read this brilliant, long essay in the New York magazine to understand how Plato described all this, and it is happening just as he predicted. Trump says he will Make America Great Again, when in fact America is currently great, according to pretty well any statistics. He is using passion, anger and rhetoric in the same way all his predecessors did  a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger, creating a cult around himself. You can blame society, politicians, the media, for America getting to the point that its ready for Trump, but the bigger historical picture is that history generally plays out the same way each time someone like him becomes the boss.

On a wider stage, zoom out some more, Russia is a dictatorship with a charismatic leader using fear and passion to establish a cult around himself. Turkey is now there too. Hungary, Poland, Slovakia are heading that way, and across Europe more Trumps and Putins are waiting in the wings, in fact funded by Putin, waiting for the popular tide to turn their way.

We should be asking ourselves what our Archduke Ferdinand moment will be. How will an apparently small event trigger another period of massive destruction. We see Brexit, Trump, Putin in isolation. The world does not work that way? ? all things are connected and affecting each other. I have pro-Brexit friends who say, Oh, youre going to blame that on Brexit too?? But they dont realize that actually, yes, historians will trace neat lines from apparently unrelated events back to major political and social shifts like Brexit.

We are entering a bad phase. It will be unpleasant for those living through it, maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination.
Brexit  a group of angry people winning a fight  easily inspires other groups of angry people to start a similar fight, empowered with the idea that they may win. That alone can trigger chain reactions. A nuclear explosion is not caused by one atom splitting, but by the impact of the first atom that splits causing multiple other atoms near it to split, and they in turn causing multiple atoms to split. The exponential increase in atoms splitting, and their combined energy is the bomb. That is how World War One started and, ironically how World War Two ended.
An example of how Brexit could lead to a nuclear war could be this:

Brexit in the UK causes Italy or France to have a similar referendum. Le Pen wins an election in France. Europe now has a fractured EU. The EU, for all its many awful faults, has prevented a war in Europe for longer than ever before. The EU is also a major force in suppressing Putins military ambitions. European sanctions on Russia really hit the economy, and helped temper Russias attacks on Ukraine (there is a reason bad guys always want a weaker European Union). Trump wins in the US. Trump becomes isolationist, which weakens NATO. He has already said he would not automatically honor NATO commitments in the face of a Russian attack on the Baltics.

With a fractured EU, and weakened NATO, Putin, facing an ongoing economic and social crisis in Russia, needs another foreign distraction around which to rally his people. He funds far right anti-EU activists in Latvia, who then create a reason for an uprising of the Russian Latvians in the East of the country (the EU border with Russia). Russia sends peace keeping forces and aid lorries into Latvia, as it did in Georgia, and in Ukraine. He cedes Eastern Latvia as he did Eastern Ukraine (Crimea has the same population as Latvia, by the way).

A divided Europe, with the leaders of France, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and others now pro-Russia, anti-EU, and funded by Putin, overrule calls for sanctions or a military response. NATO is slow to respond: Trump does not want America to be involved, and a large part of Europe is indifferent or blocking any action. Russia, seeing no real resistance to their actions, move further into Latvia, and then into Eastern Estonia and Lithuania. The Baltic States declare war on Russia and start to retaliate, as they have now been invaded so have no choice. Half of Europe sides with them, a few countries remain neutral, and a few side with Russia. Where does Turkey stand on this? How does ISIS respond to a new war in Europe? Who uses a nuclear weapon first?

This is just one Arch Duke Ferdinand scenario. The number of possible scenarios are infinite due to the massive complexity of the many moving parts. And of course many of them lead to nothing happening. But based on history we are due another period of destruction, and based on history all the indicators are that we are entering one.

It will come in ways we cant see coming, and will spin out of control so fast people wont be able to stop it. Historians will look back and make sense of it all and wonder how we could all have been so nave. How could I sit in a nice caf in London, writing this, without wanting to run away. How could people read it and make sarcastic and dismissive comments about how pro-Remain people should stop whining, and how we shouldnt blame everything on Brexit. Others will read this and sneer at me for saying America is in great shape, that Trump is a possible future Hitler (and yes, Godwins Law. But my comparison is to another narcissistic, charismatic leader fanning flames of hatred until things spiral out of control). Its easy to jump to conclusions that oppose pessimistic predictions based on the weight of history and learning. Trump won against the other Republicans in debates by countering their claims by calling them names and dismissing them. Its an easy route but the wrong one.

Ignoring and mocking the experts, as people are doing around Brexit and Trumps campaign, is no different to ignoring a doctor who tells you to stop smoking, and then finding later youve developed incurable cancer. A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if youd listened and thought a bit. But people smoke, and people die from it. That is the way of the human.

We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups, try to cross the ever widening social divides.
So I feel its all inevitable. I dont know what it will be, but we are entering a bad phase. It will be unpleasant for those living through it, maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination. Humans will come out the other side, recover and move on. The human race will be fine, changed, maybe better. But for those at the sharp end  for the thousands of Turkish teachers who just got fired, for the Turkish journalists and lawyers in prison, for the Russian dissidents in gulags, for people lying wounded in French hospitals after terrorist attacks, for those yet to fall, this will be their Somme.

What can we do? Well, again, looking back, probably not much. The liberal intellectuals are always in the minority. See Clay Shirkys Twitter Storm on this point. The people who see that open societies, being nice to other people, not being racist, not fighting wars, is a better way to live, they generally end up losing these fights. They dont fight dirty. They are terrible at appealing to the populace. They are less violent, so end up in prisons, camps, and graves. We need to beware not to become divided (see: Labour party), we need to avoid getting lost in arguing through facts and logic, and counter the populist messages of passion and anger with our own similar messages. We need to understand and use social media.

We need to harness a different fear. Fear of another World War nearly stopped World War 2, but didnt. We need to avoid our own echo chambers. Trump and Putin supporters dont read the Guardian, so writing there is just reassuring our friends. We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups, try to cross the ever widening social divides.

Facebook encourages users to keep an open mind by seeking out posts that dont appear in their feeds.

To demonstrate how reality may differ for different Facebook users, The Wall Street Journal created two feeds, one blue and the other red. If a source appears in the red feed, a majority of the articles shared from the source were classified as very conservatively aligned in a large 2015 Facebook study.

"78 Republican politicians donors and officials who are supporting Hillary Clinton
","The list of Republicans supporting Hillary Clinton is still growing. For months, we have been keeping track of all of the GOP politicians, administration officials, business leaders and donors who have crossed over to back Clinton over Donald Trump.

The most recent high-profile announced was from former secretary of state Colin Powell. ""General Powell said at a meeting of the Long Island Association that he would be voting for Hillary Clinton,"" spokeswoman Peggy Cifrino said in late October. Powell added in a brief interview with The Post's Karen DeYoung that he picked Clinton ""because I think shes qualified, and the other gentleman is not qualified.

Powell's support isn't much of a surprise, given his support for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and clear distaste for Donald Trump. In his leaked emails from last month, Powell also appeared to be talking over the best time to announce his support for Clinton.

But at least it's official now. And Powell is now the third Bush Cabinet official to support Clinton.

Undeniable Foul Play: U.S. Funded Facilities In Afghanistan Now Missing As Obama Leaves Office,"U.S. Agency for International Developments (USAID) worked in Afghanistan from July 2008 through June 2015 under the Obama administration. The work there included supporting 30 Afghan health facilities. They spend nearly $260 million through the Partnership Contracts for Health Program.

The logic seems sounds, in a country at war; we can help by providing health care. Unfortunately, it seems that USAID is not accomplishing their tasks.

On the website, the USAID claims that during the current administration, The Agency began rebuilding with an eye to getting the most bang out of its funding allocations. This must be code for, We will take millions to build hospitals and lose them, because this is exactly what the group has done.

Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) John Sopko wrote to the agency, stating, One Afghanistan hospital funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development was located more than 430 miles away from the listed coordinates, while another 11 facilities were more than six miles away.

The letter elaborated, SIGAR sought to conduct site inspections at 30 of 79 facilities in Badakhshan  an Afghan province  but was unable to locate one facility. SIGAR found substantial inaccuracies in the geospatial coordinates USAID previously provided for many of these 29 health facilities and observed that not all facilities had access to electricity and drinking water.


The money to help is going somewhere else

Sopko went on to say that only 12 of the inspected facilities were located near the coordinates USAID provided. This means that only about 15% of the hospitals were in the places they were supposed to be.

In some cases, the coordinates given were not even in the correct country, coordinates for 22 of the 79 facilities were not located in the districts listed in the most recent information available to USAID. Coordinates for two health facilities were located in Pakistan; Afghanistans neighboring country to the southeast.

One health facility was actually listed as being in the Mediterranean Sea by USAID. Others were miles from the reported coordinates, four were more than six miles away from their listed coordinates, and another three were between three and six miles away. Another six facilities were between just over a half mile and three miles away, while nine were actually located within about a half mile of their listed location.

It seems as though this has been an ongoing problem for USAID. As SIGAR has stressed previously, robust program oversight requires specific knowledge of the location where the service is provided, Sopko wrote to USAID Administrator Gayle Smith.

A USAID official reported that it would not bother correcting the problem, The agency no longer maintains location data and obtaining it would require a specialized request to the Afghan government, which USAID was unwilling to make.

Sopko countered this statement, USAIDs position regarding its monitoring responsibilities is troubling. [W]e encourage USAID to request and maintain this information, in order to help ensure that funding spent to improve the health of specific populations is actually reaching the intended communities.

It would seem necessary for someone to step in and stop the funding to this program until it starts reporting correctly. Sopko emphasized the importance of this when he stated, Maintaining accurate GPS data would help the USAID conduct site visits and help ensure that the intended communities receive needed health services.

Instead of taking a closer look at what is really happening, the agency will go on funding health centers, providing another $228 million for the facilities. In turn, the United States will keep funding USAID. The bizarre circle of corruption will continue.

USAID has clearly stated their intentions going forward, USAID does not intend to maintain coordinates. They will instead rely on the World Bank and the Afghan government who are now handling the facilities.

Given this set of facts, the U.S. needs to withdraw its funding of the agency. Obama and liberals shown no signs that this will happen though.

The facilities that SIGAR Sopko was able to inspect were in poor condition. [W]e did observe some basic structural concerns at most of the facilities, such as cracked walls, leaking roofs, broken doors, and shattered windows, which indicate clear concerns with sanitation and safety.  Inspectors also found exposed wiring. Electrical deficiencies, such as exposed live wires, pose serious hazards that could endanger the safety of patients and staff.


Horrible conditions

This brings a chilling image of what kind of care the patients might be receiving. Liberals are not concerned that millions are disappearing into a bottomless pit.

Millions have gone to fund clinics that are either misplaced or in such disrepair that they should be closed. Millions more will be given before this funding runs out.

Why is nobody in Washington asking questions?

The answers will leave the White House with Obama. His dirty hands are all over this one as he stands in front of the American public and claims he is concerned, that the government is helping innocent citizens in the war torn country of Afghanistan.

As usual, this is all lies. A more likely scenario, given what we know now, is that he needed a reason to funnel money into the country and the facade of health clinics was believable at the time.

No more money should be sent to any program that Obama has started overseas. His close ties to terrorists should raise red flags for every American.

President Trump needs to undo all of these  projects so that we no longer operate maliciously, negligently, or in a corrupt manner.",F
REPORT: HILLARY IGNITES SOROS-FUNDED PURPLE REVOLUTION AGAINST TRUMP,"While blasting so-called fake news on Thursday, Hillary Clinton once again wore the color purple which signifies George Soros color revolution against the Donald Trump presidency.
Clinton, who has deep ties to Soros, also wore purple during her concession speech on Nov. 9.
Soros, a socialist billionaire best known for breaking the British pound in 1992, has funded government overthrows, known as color revolutions, in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries in the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and North Africa.
And now hes trying to do the same using far-left radicals in the U.S., if Hillarys recent penchant for the color purple is any indication.
But why purple? Its the color resulting from mixing red and blue  and Clinton and others pushing the upcoming purple revolution will likely justify it as the unification of the divided red and blue states of America.
Anytime globalist politicians embrace a color, be on guard for a revolution bearing that particular hue, reported D.C. journalist Wayne Madsen. On the day after the election that propelled Donald Trump into the White House, Hillary and Bill Clinton entered the ballroom of the Moonie Unification Church-owned New Yorker hotel in midtown Manhattan adorned in the color purple.
Mrs. Clinton wore a pant suit with purple lapels and a purple blouse, while Bill Clinton wore a purple tie.
Already many of the nationwide protests since the election were coordinated by the Soros-funded activist group MoveOn.org.
When it comes to themed revolutions, the Sorosites have refined the art to a science, Madsen added. While Mrs. Clinton called for uniting the nation in her concession speech, Soross minions took the streets in protests, some turning violent, across the United States.
Clinton, who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from Soros, showed her real intentions by signaling the start of Soross Purple Revolution in the United States.",F
Recent Study Shows Nearly Six in Ten Trump Supporters are Illiterate,"CULLMAN, Al.  An independent study conducted by the bipartisan policy group Alliance for Community Organizations seeking Reform Now has determined that just over fifty-nine percent of voters who support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suffer from moderate to severe illiteracy.

Posing as representatives from the Nationalist Reform Council  a fictional conservative action group  ACORN officials staged several mock elections last month at community centers throughout Cullman County, Alabama, under the pretense of helping residents register to vote in time for the general election. We were really pleased with the turnout, said Matthew Breyer, who heads ACORNs northern Alabama office. We were able to register nearly twenty thousand voters over the span of three days.

Once residents were successfully registered to vote, ACORN officials ushered them into a room where about a dozen voting booths had been set up. We wanted to get an idea of the average voters understanding of the election process, Breyer said before adding that voters were asked to enter a booth and cast their vote for the candidate of their choice. However, unbeknownst to participants, the ballots had been slightly altered. Under the category U.S. President/U.S. Vice President, you had the option for Clinton/Kaine centered inside a solid red rectangle, Breyer explained. Likewise, the option for Trump/Pence was centered inside a solid blue rectangle.

Following the simulations conclusion, ACORN officials were amazed to discover that more than two-thirds of registered Republicans in Cullman County who participated in the mock election had cast their votes in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She won by a massive landslide, recalled Breyer. The data we collected seems to suggest that a sizable number of Republican voters are unable to read above a third grade level and are simply casting votes by selecting the color that corresponds with their preferred party.

This should be a major wake up call and I think we need to take a hard look at the educational system in this country, said Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Barry King. This may have been a simulation but weve got multiple GOP leaders saying theres going to be a rigged election next month. Theres a legitimate fear that youll have altered ballots just like this popping up all over the country and as a result, well be forced to suffer another four years under Obamas failed policies.

In recent days, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has increasingly warned supporters that the upcoming presidential election will be rigged against him. Of course there is a large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day, the former reality TV star tweeted on Monday. Trump has called on his supporters to closely monitor voting centers and has said that he will not willingly accept defeat in the event Clinton secures the presidency.S

urkey President Claims Has Video Evidence Obama Is Supporting ISIS,"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is once again making accusations that the United States is directly supporting ISIS. Hes been mixed up in rumors of his supposed profiteering from the illicit ISIS oil trade in the past, so his accusations carry with them a need for healthy skepticism. Still, he is adamant in his allegations and says hes got irrefutable evidence.

His claims go beyond the single step of removal from direct involvement, our maintaining the implausible plausible deniability of aiding the so-called freedom fighters or rebels, the insulation the US has relied upon in arming, training and financing Obamas terrorist allies in the past. Its more than an acknowledgment of the rebranding of ISIS terrorists, our supposed enemy, as anonymous factions under the White House subversive.

Its beyond the contention of the Russians or the photographic evidence that John McCain was foolish enough to provide, what is basically little more than a choice in headscarf colors, the difference between their equivalent of the crips and the bloods, as being the legitimizing factor for aiding our terrorist enemies as the non-existent moderate freedom fighters.

Erdogan said in his Tuesday comments that he has confirmed evidence that US-led forces have supported ISIS. Erdogan stated in no uncertain terms that its very clear the US is supporting ISIS. He said, They were accusing us of supporting Daesh (ISIS). Now they give support to terrorist groups including Daesh, YPG, PYD. Its very clear. We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos. YPG and PYD are Kurdish groups that Erdogan regards as terrorists operating against Turkey.

Flanked by the visiting Guinean President Alpha Conde, Erdogan said, The coalition forces are unfortunately not keeping their promises. Whether they do or they dont, we will continue along this path in a determined way. There is no going back on the path we have set out on.

Erdogan complained They are supporting all the terror groups  the YPG, PYD but also including Daesh (ISIS)  Its quite clear, perfectly obvious, he said, adding that Turkey could provide proof in pictures and video. During a November visit to Pakistan Erdogan made similar claims, alleging the West stands by Daesh (ISIS) right now and its weapons were Western-made. At the time he declined to provide his evidence for inspection.

He needs to be more forthcoming this time around. If hes got the evidence, show it. Certainly none of us would be surprised to learn that Obama is behind ISIS, its already well known. We would like to put our hands on his proof, though, in order to properly charge Obama and convict him.",F
BOOM! The House Just Voted 383-0 In Support of Christians Obama Isnt Happy About This,"The Obama administration refuses to even utter the words radical Islamic terrorism, so its no surprise that they have refused to call the murders of Christians by ISIS genocide, but thats exactly what it is. ISIS is literally trying to totally eliminate entire populations of people who do not believe the way they do.

When the House votes 383-0 against Obama, you know there is something majorly wrong with the mentality of the White House.

From Fox News:

The House approved a resolution Monday that declares the Islamic State is committing genocide against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East  putting even more pressure on the Obama administration to do the same ahead of a deadline later this week.

The resolution passed the House with a unanimous vote of 383-0.

The resolution came to a vote just days after the release of a graphic new report by the Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians on ISIS atrocities. The report made the case that the terror campaign against Christians and other minorities in Syria, Iraq and other parts of the Middle East is, in fact, genocide.

When ISIS systematically targets Christians, Yezidis, and other ethnic and religious minorities for extermination, this is not only a grave injusticeit is a threat to civilization itself, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., said in a statement. We must call the violence by its proper name: genocide.

The resolution was voted on ahead of a congressionally mandated March 17 deadline for Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House to make a decision on whether to make such a declaration. The measure is an effort to force the administrations hand on the issue, as the administration has so far declined to take an official position.

There is a similar measure in the Senate that has yet to be voted on.

Obama may want to protect Islam and disregard Christians, but it is abundantly clear there are hundreds of leaders in the House and Senate who do not agree with Obamas notions.

If the resolution passes the Senate at a similar margin as the house, it will solidify the level of embarrassment our country feels toward Obama.",F
Dear Media LIARS: Heres Who Is REALLY Responsible For Berlin Terror Attack,"The Berlin attack is opening peoples eyes to the situation at hand, and they are blaming terrorist organizations like ISIS, but theyre not the only ones facing peoples wrath.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing huge backlash in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that killed 12 peoplebecause of her open immigration policies, as per The Sun.

Many people are saying it is because of her that this attack took place, because of her sympathy for Muslim refugees seeking asylum in any country that will take them.

But theres one problem with these refugeeswherever they go, attacks, murders, and rapes are increasing. Anywhere where these migrants are, violence follows.

Its not looking good for the chancellor, who is up for reelection soon. She may not even get a chance to do so with so many of the German people calling for her blood. Many are blaming her for these deaths of innocent people.

These are Merkels dead, said Marcus Pretzell, chairman of the Alternative for Germany party in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Klaus Bouillon of Merkels CDU party also said to Saarland radio: We must state that we are in a state of war, although some people who want to see only the good cannot see.

Merkel was attending the ironically named International Day of Migrants when the attack took place, and she stated she was shocked and shaken by the tragedy that had taken place. Merkel can pretty much kiss her career goodbye.

The German people are no longer as sympathetic to immigrants as some German politicians, due to the increase in assaults they are witnessing. Similar incidents have taken place in Ansbach, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Stuttgart, and Bielefeld.

Merkels opponents are sure to be gaining more popularity as more are leaning towards the right and calling for these refugees to be booted out of the country. Many European countries are regretting their decisions to let these migrants into their countries.

This is why so many are intolerant of the Islamic faith and having these immigrants in their countriesviolence seems to follow them everywhere they go since for every three or four peaceful Muslims, there is one bent on destruction. Many other countries, including America, have seen increased attacks stemming from these migrants.

They all need to go back to their own countries, plain and simple. Its like being in a destructive relationshiptheyre already going to tear themselves down, but if you cut-sling, you dont have to go down with them. And the American people are not going down with them.

And Im sure that the German people dont want to go down either. Merkel is sure to not be elected next year for her fourth term as chancellor, especially with Pretzell laying the blame at her feet. Its time to cease the sympathy for Muslim migrants, because its only hurting the countries that take them in.",F
"Heading out the door, Obama bans offshore drilling in Atlantic, Arctic Oceans","Trump might be able to reverse it, but its tricky.

Hes only got a few weeks left to damage Americas energy independence. Obama needs to work fast, and he is. Ever the creative one, Obama has found a way to twist the original intent of a law passed in 1953 to enact bans on offshore drilling in massive sections of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The law was never intended to facilitate any such action, as The Hill explains, but since when does Obama consider himself constrained by the law?

Obama will use a section of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to implement the protections, Bloomberg and The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the plans.

Its unclear, however, how large Obamas protected areas will be.

The action would answer calls from environmentalists to implement so-called 12(a) protections in the Atlantic and Arctic as a more lasting legacy against fossil fuels from Obama.

Obama last month made final a plan for offshore drilling lease sales from 2017 to 2022 that excludes the Atlantic and Arctic.

But that plans time period is limited, and President-elect Donald Trump can revise the plan to insert lease sales if he wishes.

Previous presidents have used the 1953 law rarely. In each case, they focused on small areas of water and set time limits in an effort to protect particular species.

Its unclear how easily Trump can undo the protections, since no previous president has tried to roll back a predecessors actions under that law. Congress may also step in to undo Obamas actions.

This is a classic act of recklessness on Obamas part  applying a law beyond all recognition of its original intent, and telling American oil companies they cant explore gigantic portions of the world. Just because hes Barack Obama and he hates fossil fuels. He also leave a mess for Donald Trump to try to clean up, if he can.

Can he?

Maybe. The most effective way for Trump to reverse Obamas heading-out-the-door finger in the eye to Americas oil industry, if not necessarily the simplest, would be to ask Congress to make an amendment to the law, essentially nullifying Obamas actions. He could also amend Obamas drilling lease plan for the period of 2017-2022 by adding more leases, conceivably in the areas of the Atlantic and Arctic where Obama is trying to ban them.

What Trump might try to do instead is simply declare that Obamas action under the law is null and void at the executive level, and substitute his own. Its not clear how much force of law Obamas action has, although its not purely an executive order because he did take the action under an existing statute  albeit very far afield from the original intent of the statute.

I suspect that if Trump simply tries to reverse Obamas actions unilaterally, there will be political resistance but no real constituency with an avenue to effectively prevent Trumps action.

There is some luxury of time here, because at the moment most American oil companies who engage in offshore drilling do so almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore drilling in the Pacific has also been made very difficult by political resistance, and that could also be a challenge for Trumps new EPA.

In the meantime, Obama shows us once again that his priority above all else is the service of a left-wing ideological agenda. If he wanted to enact this ban at any point during his presidency, he could have done so and dealt with the political blowback. Instead, he waited until the final weeks of his presidency so he could lay this trap for his successor, and for the nation, to deal with.

As relieved as we are that we will never have to talk about President Hillary, the end of President Obama cant come soon enough either.",F

For a number of reasons that month has proven to be pivotal in the scandal over her use of a private server to conduct official State Department business, communicating by email over that server.

He points out that it was the New York Times that broke the email story back in March of 2015, with the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails indicating that the Clinton team has been scrambling ever since. Dobbs plays a clip of Obama lying about his knowledge of Clinton using a personal email account to conduct government business.

In an interview Obama was asked, Mr. president, when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State? Obama responded with a blatant lie, saying, The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.

Mr. Dobbs points out the fact that Everybody else, however, didnt believe the president when he said that. And Clintons top aide, Cheryl Mills, certainly knew better. It was she who told Podesta, We need to clean this up, noting the president has emails from Hillary that do not say State.gov.'

Dobbs goes on to tell his audience that Clinton had just days earlier conspired with Obama to hold back emails despite being subpoenaed by Congress. In that instance Podesta cities executive privilege. Dobbs points out that March was also when the firm managing her server, Platte River Networks, deleted her email archive using Bleachbit, despite that subpoena.

March was also the month that Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe suggested that the wife of a strategically placed FBI official run for the Virginia State Senate. He also donated $467,000 to her campaign and then promoted him to the number two position in the FBI, in charge of the Clinton investigation.

Dobbs closes, saying, As I have always said, there are no coincidences when it comes to the Clintons, and these latest revelations show how far their corruption extends within our government in Washington DC.",F
Obama Signs Executive Order Declaring Investigation Into Election Results; Revote Planned For Dec. 19th,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Following the results of Tuesday nights election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.

People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers, Obama told reporters. Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.

Under the Presidents order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.

Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidents decision.

Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnt allow that to happen. President Obama doesnt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.

The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college.

We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.

Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election.

Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19th. What the people are actually voting for are their states electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.

Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the Presidents Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether.

[The electoral college] is a fking joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise. Everyone should have an equal vote, and thats just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Its time to bring our system into the 21st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.

Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward.

Were going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this, Obama said. Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this? Obama said. If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.

If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19th election, you can call the Obama administrations special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.",F
"WHOA  Liberals Attacked Trump Inauguration Singer, But They Got KNOCKED OUT by America!","Finding a performer for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump has not been easy, because many famous Liberals are still sitting up on their high horses.

Jackie Evancho, a teenage opera singer who got her start on Americas Got Talent, has agreed to sing the National Anthem for the inauguration. Many liberals have attacked her and her family, but proud Americans have supported her. Her music sales have quadrupled thanks to the American people! (via Breitbart)

Evanchos 2011 Dream With Me album and her 2010 O Holy Night are both sitting at No. 2 on the Billboard charts because of the American people and the pride they have in their country and this talented girl!

For her part, Jackie Evancho has expressed her excitement to sing at this event, which is a breath of fresh air compared to the other singers who have flat out refused to be a part of it, even though they were not even asked in the first place.

I have recently been asked by the President-elect to perform the National Anthem for the swearing-in ceremony at the inauguration, Evancho stated. Im so excited. Its going to be awesome. At least someone has some American pride.

But liberals, of course, arent about to hold back their disdain, even against a teenage girl. This is particularly ironic because of the details of Evanchos family.

My family is kind of a big target. I have a transgender sister and so a lot of hate goes towards us, Evancho claimed. But I also get a lot of love. So, we pay most attention to that. Sometimes we get really annoyed with the hate, everyone does, we have to admit it but we just ignore it.

So, Liberals are adding further hate directed at an innocent family who are trying to support their transgender member. I thought liberals were supportive of transgender people? Apparently they only care about the hate directed at them if the transgender person agrees with their political views.

At 16, Jackie Evanchos list of accomplishments already includes six studio albums. Her O Holy Night EP made her the youngest solo artist to reach platinum on the U.S. Billboard and also ranked her as the No. 1 Classical Albums Artist of 2011.

As one of the few people who are scheduled to perform for Donald Trumps inauguration, the young singer clearly has a ton of talent. The Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir also planned to perform for the incoming President.

Liberals are nothing but a bunch of sore losers, and the fact that they would harass a young girl because of her choice to perform is sickening. The truth is, Liberals will direct their hatred at anyone if they cant get their way.",F
Top Black Lives Matter Activist: We Will Incite Riots Everywhere if Trump Wins,"Dear white peopleniggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go

UPDATE: Poe deleted his tweet and then claimed that he never made the comments. The tweet is archived here and a screenshot of it appears below.

Hes now whining about slander. Talk crap, then play the victim when you get challenged on your crap. Same process EVERY time with social justice warriors.

Prominent Black Lives Matter activist and rapper Tef Poe has a message for white people: If Donald Trump wins the presidency, niggas will incite riots everywhere.

Dear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know, Poe tweeted today.

He followed up with another promise: Trump wins aint no more rules fammo. Weve been too nice as is.

Poe is by no means a nobody, he has appeared in innumerable articles charting the rise of Black Lives Matter and was credited with coining the phrase, This aint your grandparents civil rights movement.

The rapper was one of the co-founders of Hands Up United, a social justice organization that emerged after the death of Michael Brown that was responsible for coordinating large BLM protests in the St. Louis area.

St. Louis was hit by riots in August last year as police were forced to use tear gas to disperse demonstrators who threw bricks and bottles at officers.

The hands up, dont shoot! mantra was later discredited by DNA and autopsy evidence that confirmed Michael Brown did not have his hands up when he was shot by Officer Darren Wilson.

Poes threat to incite riots comes on the same day as it emerged that some of the radical groups involved in shutting down Donald Trumps rally in Chicago last week are planning a mass civil disobedience movement beginning next month.

Donald Trump himself also warned that any attempt by the GOP establishment to steal the nomination from him may result in civil unrest.

I think you would have riots. I think you would have riots, Trump told CNNs Chris Cuomo this morning. I think you would see problems like youve never seen before. I think bad things would happen. I really do.

Trump was quickly blasted by many sectors of the media for invoking the prospect of riots, a sentiment that wasnt seen immediately after the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, when publications like Time Magazine argued that rioting was a justifiable form of protest.",F
Turkeys Erdogan Says U.S. Supports ISIL: We Have Evidence With Pictures & Videos,"Turkeys President Recep Erdogan has come out swinging today. With the U.S. led coalition (Britain and France included) recently suffering an embarrassing defeat in Aleppo, Syria when Iranian and Russian forces helped to liberate the city from ISIL, this latest incident could be seen as Turkey throwing salt on the U.S. wound. 

Erdogans bombshell statements highlighted what most of the world is now coming to accept as reality:

They [the U.S.] give support to terrorist groups including Daesh (IS/ISIL). We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos.

While no videos or pictures have been made public yet, the world can only hope that Erdogan and company can make good on his words by publicly disclosing their alleged evidence.

Adding to the disclosure was Irans Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan:

The Western coalition is of a formal nature, they have no real intention to fight neither in Syria nor in Iraq. We dont see any readiness on their part to play a truly useful and meaningful role in fighting IS, because its them who have raised terrorists and they are interested in keeping them there. Maybe the coalition forces would like to see terrorists weakened, but certainly not destroyed, because those terrorists are their tool for destabilizing this region and some other parts of the world.

Of course, this statement is no longer just a theory or speculation, as U.S. House Representative from Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard has introduced a bill that would stop the U.S. government from funding and supporting ISIL, both directly and indirectly. Tulsi stated a few things sure to get the attention of many:

If you or I gave money, weapons or support to al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Why does our gov get a free pass on this? The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its citizens. 

What is most interesting about Erdogans comments today then is the fact that he is calling out the U.S. government for funding and arming ISIL and other terrorists groups, when he has also been called out for doing the same. Remember from the paragraph above that Tulsi Gabbard said Turkey is one of the countries arming and funding ISIL. We must also remember when Vladimir Putin said the same thing in November of 2015.

So, perhaps Turkey (or certain aspects within the military and intelligence community within Turkey) have stopped coordinating with the CIA and other intelligence groups in helping to aid ISIL. Putin and Erdogan have made it no secret as to their willingness to collaborate more over the past several months. One of the biggest signals of this growing collaboration between Russia and Turkey was the signing of the Turkish Stream pipeline in late October. Additionally, Moscow announced today that they will be intensifying cooperation between Turkey, Iran and themselves within Syria. Maybe, just maybe, Turkey has broken ties with the Western banking/political cabal. Time will tell. 

It would make sense though in many ways if Turkey has broken off all or most ties with the Western cabal, as the world sees the writing on the wall for ISIL: Time is short.

Not only was ISIL defeated in Aleppo (the biggest battle to date), but they are being defeated in Mosul, Iraq. Today, Iraqs Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the world that ISIL would be defeated in Iraq within three months. 

Perhaps Turkey has made a full pivot East and is now working to defeat the terrorist group they were once arming and funding. Stranger things have happened. We watch in great anticipation as to what will happen next. ",F
"SARAH PALIN APPOINTED AS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ADVISER, PROMISES TO GET RID OF CLIMATE CHANGE HYSTERIA","The American President-elect Donald Trump has officially announced this morning that Sarah Palin is to become the new Science and Technology Adviser.

Critics of the administration have already voiced their concerns over the choice of the former Alaska governor, known to be a fierce climate change denier, to lead the White House Office of Science and Technology of the United States.

 Far too long has the Chinese narrative over climate change kept our economy in a rut. Its time to open the pumps and as I like to say: Drill, baby, drill! 

 Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor

 whitehousepalin
Scientists and academics alike have already voiced concerns that Sarah Palins strong disbelief in climate change could have dramatic consequences for the planet.
God killed the dinosaurs

Some scientists openly fear that Sarah Palin could be the end of the science establishment as we know it and would relegate the Office of Science and Technology to the dark ages.

I mean, this is scary as hell explains climatologist Dan B. Evans from the University of California, Berkeley.

The woman claimed in an interview in 2009 that God killed the dinosaurs and that he had sent the flood to purge the dinosaurs off of the earth, he warned, visibly concerned.

With Sarah Palin as director of the Office of Science and Technology, we are definitely stepping into la-la land he adds.

A scientific community in disbelief

Sarah Palins strong stance against climate change in the past has earned her an army of detractors, especially within environmentalist circles.

In a 2009 UN statement that acknowledged that 97% of climate experts agree humans are causing global warming, Sarah Palin responded, the documents show that there was no real consensus even within the CRU crowd and called the 2007 IPCC report a load of rubbish and a fraud.

With irresponsible leaders such as Trump and Palin in the White House, polar ice cap melting will increase dramatically and waters could rise an easy 33% in the next ten years has even admitted James Hillocks, a top Greenpeace climate scientist.

Environmentalists fear the worst as President-elect Donald Trump has already threatened to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Pact, potentially dealing a death blow to the whole accord by refuting the international consensus on climate change, believe experts.",F
"WikiLeaks  Obama Racist Recruiting  No White, Christian Americans Need Apply","Back when Hussein Obama first befouled the White House, many naive Americans still gave him the benefit of the doubt in both his honesty and his declaration that he was a Christian. Hes since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist white-hating Muslim agitator, but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time. WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearer.

There were those who knew what he was up to, but their silence had been purchased. One such individual was Preeta Bansal, who may or may not share Obamas personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his. She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime, being a naturalized Indian. Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti-white, anti-American prejudice.

673-bansal-obama-discrimination

As the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals, Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination, but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch. Thats the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ Civil Rights Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non-white. Discriminating against whites and Christians is just who we are under this racist America-hating Islamist.

One thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration. Race-based preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in. Being Arab alone wasnt enough to get you onto the good list. Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not included.

She also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers. Two questions rise from that admission; what kind of people is she seeking that blogger revelations would sink their candidacy and why did she, knowing their background difficulties, still include them as potential recruits?

Subject: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates

 

Here are the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American

candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside

boards/agencies/policy committees. A couple things to note about the list

of Muslim American candidates:

 

1) In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab

American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many

Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of

outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim

American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of

uncertain religion (esp. Christian).

 

2) There is only one candidate I thought was a viable one for a

Secretary-level job among the Muslim Americans. That said, on both lists,

there are some very senior people listed in the last category (for outside

boards/commissions) who conceivably could be considered for top jobs. The

very senior people I put on the last list tended not to be terribly

involved in politics or policy, or in the case of some Asian Americans,

had already served in the Clinton and even Carter Administrations and so I

thought we should seek new talent. But theres no magic to some of the

placements. I think the lists are fairly exhaustive, but some of the

people may be moved to other categories.

 

3) High-profile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amount

of blogger criticism, and so the individuals on this list would need to be

ESPECIALLY carefully vetted. I suspect some of the people I list would

not survive such a vet  but I do personally know, at least in part,

virtually all of the candidates in the 1st two categories (but I know very

few of those listed for outside boards/commissions).

 

4) I listed the elected Muslim American democratic officials at the end

of the second category, but for various reasons, I didnt think any of

them would necessarily be suitable for an Administration appointment.

Nevertheless, I wanted to flag them for you in case you wanted to evaluate

them further.",F
Egyptian paper: Transcript proves Kerry plotted UN resolution against Israel with Palestinians  Report,"On Tuesday, the Times of Israel reported that an Egyptian newspaper published what it called transcripts of meetings between top US officials  including Secretary of State John Kerry  and Palestinian officials that could, if true, prove Israels accusations that the Obama regime was behind the anti-Israel UN resolution approved by the Security Council.

According to the Times of Israel:

At the same time, a report in an Israeli daily Tuesday night pointed to Britain helping draft the resolution and high drama in the hours leading up to the vote, as Jerusalem tried to convince New Zealand to bury the Security Council measure.

In a meeting in early December with top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, US Secretary of State John Kerry told the Palestinians that the US was prepared to cooperate with the Palestinians at the Security council, Israels Channel 1 TV said, quoting the Egyptian Al-Youm Al-Sabea newspaper.

Also present at the meeting were US National Security Adviser Susan Rice, and Majed Faraj, director of the Palestinian Authoritys General Intelligence Service.

Kerry is quoted as saying that he could present his ideas for a final status solution if the Palestinians pledge they will support the proposed framework. The US officials advised the Palestinians to travel to Riyadh to present the plan to Saudi leaders.

According to the Times, the Egyptian report fits Israeli claims that it has ironclad proof the Obama regime helped craft the anti-settlement resolution.

We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage, said David Keyes, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Additionally, the Guardian said Israel may provide this information to the incoming Trump administration:

Doubling down on the claim a few hours later the controversial Israeli ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, went even further suggesting it had gathered evidence that it would present to the incoming Trump administration.

We will present this evidence to the new administration through the appropriate channels. If they want to share it with the American people, they are welcome to do it, Dermer told CNN.

According to Dermer, not only did the US not stand by Israels side during the vote, it was behind this ganging up on Israel at the UN.

Jeff Dunetz noted:

Israel fears that Kerry lays out his comprehensive vision for two-state solution and then turns it into another Security Council resolution imposing additional anti-Israel settlement terms on Israel, or at upcoming peace conference in Paris on Jan. 15 that Israel is not attending, all before the Israel-hating Obama leaves the White House three weeks from this coming Friday. Another possibility is the US recognizing a Palestinian State, any of the above eliminates the possibility of a negotiated solution.

The Egyptian report did not detail whose transcripts of the meeting it had obtained or how it had obtained them.

At the end of the meeting, the report said,  Rice and Kerry requested that the content of the discussion remain secret because of the sensitivity of the matter during the transition period in the U.S. The same way Kerry kept negotiations for the Iran deal secret from Israel until it was too late.

The Obama regime, however, has denied allegations that it was behind the resolution.

We did not draft this resolution; we did not introduce this resolution. We made this decision when it came up for a vote, Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday.",F
99% of Americans Didnt Spot CRAZY Thing That Happened THE SECOND Trump Won Primaries!,"Right after Donald Trump won the primary and caucus voting on Tuesday night, Donald Trump delivered a victory speech where he made an effort to reach out to voters that supported other candidates.

Ed Klein: Hillarys Delusion: Im Going to Run Again in 2020,"Hillary Clinton intends to keep her campaign organization together for the next four years and run again for president in 2020.

Shes convinced that, sooner than later, the voters will come to their senses and realize they made a horrible mistake by putting [Donald] Trump in the White House, a source close to Hillary told Ed Klein Confidential. Shes sure the voters will beg her to get in the race and she says, Im going to run again in 2020.

Not all her advisers agree. In fact, several of them believe Hillary is in a bad waydeeply depressed, drinking too much, and delusional about her chances of making a successful run for the White House four years from now when shell be 73 and in shaky health.

But these advisers are afraid to dash Hillarys presidential dreams and send her into an even deeper depression.

Hillary is in a state of denial and accepts zero responsibility for her loss to Trump, one of these sources said. Shes convinced that [FBI Director James] Comeys last-minute announcement that he was reopening his investigation of Hillarys emails was planned in advance by her Republican enemies. Shes also convinced that [Russian president Vladimir] Putin was working with Trump and that the two were in direct contact.

She further believes that a groundswell of anger is going to make it impossible for Trump to govern effectively, the source continued. In her view, Trump is a rank amateur in the art of politics, and hes going to screw up badly and find himself in deep trouble.

She told meand Im paraphrasing: Trump has no idea what its like to run the biggest corporation in the world, the United States government. He has no fg idea how complicated it is, how many cogs are spinning at the same time, how many people are fighting at cross purposes, how much disinformation you get.

According to sources close to Bill Clinton, he does not want Hillary to run again. Given his own serious health problems, Bill doubts he will be in any shape to help Hillary four years from now.

Bill hopes Hillary will see the light and change her mind, a source close to Bill said. Hes sure the party will want a fresh new face come 2020.",F

"BREAKING  Dems Caught Counting Hillary Votes 6 TIMES In THIS City, TIME FOR PRISON!","It turns out that the election may have been rigged after all. Its just that Hillary Clinton and her Democrats cant do any job right.

Entire precincts surrounding Detroit may be un-recountable, due to suspected voter fraud! Officials have found that, in hundreds of cases, the poll book numbers do not match the electronic voting machine printouts, as per The Detroit News.

Michigan state law holds that if a precinct is unable to be recounted, then the original count must stand.

Some of the problems may be due to biased elections staff. The machines used in Michigan, according to Detroit Elections Director Daniel Baxter, are quite old. In fact, 87 of the machines optical scanners broke on election day.

When there is such a problem with the machines, a ballot may get jammed in the scanner. The election staff then has to pull the ballot out and try again. This could result in a ballot being counted twice, or even six times, as the staff tries to get the ballot into the machine again and again.

The staff can manually erase the duplicate votes, but Baxter says that in many cases, [they] failed to do so. What, they forgot? Or perhaps they wanted to count the vote multiple times?

Of course, many of these precincts are strongly Democrat, at least according to historic voting trends. This includes Wayne County where Clinton received roughly two-thirds of the vote. If such widespread voter fraud has occurred, perhaps Michigan is a lot less blue than we thought.

There are other explanations for the vote discrepancies as well. As WND is reporting, Republican candidate Ken Crider has been keeping a close eye on his Districts elections process. Crider said, in a Facebook post, Pennys precinct, Detroit Precinct #152, had an unbroken seal and everything looked proper. The tag on the box said 306 and the book said 306 and the ticket said 306, so there should be 306 paper ballots on the box, right?

Well, when they pulled out the ballots, the stack seemed short, and when they finished separating the two page ballot to count the presidential page only, guess how many ballots were in the box? 304 no, 299 nope, 200 nada, how about 100 wrong again. There were only exactly 50 paper ballots in a locked sealed box that again was supposed to have 306. HMMMM. Crider is right to point out this mysterious circumstance.

If the seal was unbroken and there were no holes in the ballot box, then why was there an incorrect amount of ballots in there? It would be understandable to be off by one vote, but to be off by hundreds is highly suspicious and points, once again, to the election staff.

In my opinion, each of these staff members should be barred from working elections again. Whether through negligence or intention, something very bad has been going on here.

Over the course of the past month, Obama added a record number of new regulations across a myriad of federal agencies that try to control our lives  and livelihoods. In the past few days, he surpassed his own record and likely isnt done trying to curtail President-Elect Trumps authority after he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.

Obama instructed his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from a vote which drastically impacted one of our most staunch allies, Israel. A veto by the United States, which has been done in the past, would have prevented the U.N. Security Council from attempting to create a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians by demanding that settlement building in disputed areas cease immediately.

Very quietly, Obama also welcomed more than 2,000 new Muslim refugees onto American soil. These people, largely men, already had their asylum requests denied by the Australian government. They were being held in a detention facility when Obama decided the American taxpayers should begin paying for their resettlement  regardless of the risks to national security.

President Obama had heralded George W. Bushs commitment to a respectful transition and promised his distraught staff would adhere to the same level of professionalism and decorum. Instead, he led the charge to behave like a petulant spoiled child himself.

First, Michelle Obama sat down for a chat with Oprah Winfrey and claimed America is now without hope. Tens of millions of Americans are feeling hopeful for the first time in eight years, but those of us who live in flyover country or are part of blue collar communities or the middle class really dont matter to liberals.

Lashing out at Donald Trump because We the People chose him over a corrupt, lying career politician simply showcases how shallow and self-involved Barack Obama and his wife truly are. There is nothing Democrats in Congress can do to stop Trumps agenda from passingthanks to Harry Reids short-sighted pushing for the nuclear option.

Michael Moore and his horde of liberal followers will not be able to stop Trump from being sworn in on January 20  nor will they succeed in pushing his oath-taking ceremony inside. The efforts of #Disrupt20 protesters will fail just as surely as Jill Steins recount endeavors.

If Barack Obama wanted his legacy to involve appearing small, glib, and completely delusional, he has succeeded. He is now nothing more than a frustrating nuisance for President-Elect Donald Trump and the patriotic Americans who cast ballots in his favor. Soon Obama will finally be gone, and Trump can repeal his foolish liberal regulations and executive orders and put the nation back on the track to greatness and prosperity for ALL!",F
URGENT: Clinton Arrested For DUI In California!,"Hillary Clintons brother-in-law Roger Clinton was arrested over the weekend in Los Angeles. According to reports, he was driving under the influence.

TMZ reported the arrest the other day. It came days before Californias primary. This just looks bad on her. These are the type of people the Clinton family produces: alcoholics.

*** I bet she is losing it right now.

That dunce is Hillary Clinton's Brother-in-law
That dunce is Hillary Clintons Brother-in-law
Roger Clinton was arrested after 8 PM in Redondo Beach. According to TMZ, He was booked for driving under the influence, he remains in police custody. His bail is set to $15,000.

*** You can see the kind of kin that the Clintons keep on display here.

They are a family of criminals. They know how to steal and do drugs. Bill Clinton allegedly loves to snort coke with any hooker he can find and Hillary Clinton loves to threaten people. They are a pair made for each other in hell. Toss in the brother-in-law and youve got trio thatll make Freddie Krueger look like a nice person.


Look at that picture above. Now, look at this picture of Hillary Clinton. Tell me which one is scarier below in the comments.

<> on April 10, 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

UNLESS HE BAILS OUT BEFORE TUESDAY  THERE GOES ONE VOTE FOR HILLARY, TMZ SAID.

Hillary Clinton needs all the votes she can get. If you remember, Bill Clinton pardoned Roger Clinton for cocaine-related charge as his final executive act as president. (h/t Daily Caller)",F
"Trump Accuser Was Paid $500,000 TO LIE FOR HILLARY","Just before the presidential election there seemed to be a new woman coming forward every day claiming to have been sexually harassed by The Donald Trump.

It could also be that there isnt much merit to such claims of abuse. Trump has been in the public eye for long time   and yet every single one of his accusers waited until within one month of a national election to come forward? Theyre all aware of how wealthy the man is, and couldve come forward years (or in some cases, decades) ago and walked away with nice settlements if their claims were true. The fact that they didnt bother to do so gives me the impression that theyre looking for attention  or to sway the election.

Summer Zervos the Ex-Apprentice loser who claimed Donald Trump sexually assaulted her was paid $500,000 by lawyer Gloria Allred to fabricate the story. Allred is a Hillary Clinton collaborator and DNC Assosciate. According to an anonymous source this deal was reportedly shopped around to other ex-Apprentice contestants, which makes sense now.

Everyday for about a week we saw one accuser after another come forth. We must share this to as many people as we can to vindicate Donald Trump.  Zervos sexual harassment accusation against Trump is a completely fabricated hoax. Zervos was paid half a million dollars by Gloria Allred, which is being paid out slowly over time .

 Zervos was a big league Trump supporter who converted her whole family to the Trump Train until she met Gloria Allred, as was reported before. Money talks!",F
"Escaped ISIS Sex Slave Goes Before Congress, DESTROYS Obama With 1 Devastating Sentence","A woman who knows first-hand the brutality of ISIS testified before Congress not too long ago, and she had some pretty damning words for outgoing President Obama.

The USA must act. We must terminate DAESH [Islamic State] and all such terror, former ISIS sex slave Nadia Murad said through a translator.


Murad, who escaped captivity in 2014, also spoke out on the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando that killed 49 Americans. She said she wasnt surprised.

I knew if ISIS were not stopped, they would spread their crimes everywhere.

And just like a cancer that continues to metastasize and slowly eat away at a persons insides, her self-fulfilling prophecy has come true in more ways than one.

Obama is just like an inept doctor in that regard, and Murad called him out on it:

If a country as strong as your country cannot protect its citizens in Orlando, or in Belgium or in France, how come a small minority like us can protect ourselves while we are in the heart of the land where radicals are? Murad said bravely.

Well, Ms. Murad, it might have something to do with the fact we are knee-deep in the bull pen called political correctness. Obamas decision not to call radical Islamic terrorism by its name and his choice to redact the original 9-1-1 transcript from the Pulse gunman bore witness to that fact back in June.

And where was the outrage after the Pulse massacre when the 2013 FBI investigation into the gunman was dropped due to concerns of Islamophobia? Where is the outrage now that 12 people in Berlin are dead and their families devastated? Wheres the outrage that Russia has responded appropriately while we are still sitting on our butts? Dont we realize President Obama could have prevented all of this a long time ago?

Ill bet Nadia Murad does. Our president should have lost his right to govern for not responding effectively to this threat. He and his liberal brethren just call people on the other side of the aisle racist and allow the bodies to continue to pile up due to their inept leadership.

Electoral voters now subjected to brutal wave of death threats and intimidation psyops faithless votes being coerced to throw the election,"(NaturalNews) If a thug points a gun to your head, hands you a piece of paper, and says, Sign this contract, is the contract legally binding?

Of course it isnt. It was coerced under the threat of violence, and no court in the nation would uphold the contract as legally binding.

Yet right now, electoral voters all across America are being essentially held at gunpoint, threatened with being killed if they dont change their votes to oppose Donald Trump. The dishonest mainstream media is further amplifying the coercion by running an organized psyop campaign of disinfo (psyop means psychological operations) which falsely claims the Russians hacked the election, despite the complete absence of a shred of evidence to support the narrative.

The Russian hack conspiracy delusion has already been completely discredited. It turns out the DNC emails were leaked by a democrat insider who supported Bernie Sanders. The handing over of the emails took place in a wooded area in Washington D.C. and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russians.

Electors around the country are being harassed with a barrage of emails, phone calls and letters  and even death threats  in an effort to block Donald Trump from being voted in as president by the Electoral College on Monday, reports the NY Post today.

The NY Post also reports:

Reports of GOP electors being badgered have been reported in numerous states, including Georgia, Idaho, Tennessee, Arizona, Utah and Michigan.

For Michael Banerian, a senior at Oakland University in Michigan and a Republican elector, the harassment comes with a dark side.

He said hes been getting death threats via email, snail mail, Twitter and Facebook.

Somebody threatened to put a bullet in the back of my mouth, Banerian, 22, told The Post on Wednesday.

Leftists are kidnapping electoral voters and holding them for ransom

What you may not know is that these death threats are a coordinated campaign to threaten electoral voters into throwing the election. Yet the very existence of such persistent, coordinated death threats means that We the People must correct the electoral votes, knowing that many such votes will be cast under the threat of being killed. Thus, electoral votes cast under threat or violence are not legally binding. They may be reclaimed by the courts and corrected to represent the will of the voters in their states.

In essence, the political left  organized by international terrorist money man George Soros and people with ties to both the White House and Hillary Clinton  has psychologically kidnapped the electoral voters, and theyre demanding a kind of ransom or they will be killed. That ransom is a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump.

In other words, this is a political mugging where the radical left is holding a gun to their heads and saying, Your vote or your life.

And if they manage to switch 37 electoral votes through such death threats, the left will declare a victory for America, proclaiming the very people they threatened with being killed as being heroes for saving the country.

Unbelievable, isnt it? This is right out of the Kim Jong-Un playbook for how to run a brutal dictatorship, which is probably why the radical left loves it so much. If you do what they want, youre heralded as a national hero. If you dont do what they want, you get a bullet in the head.

This really is the way liberals exert power, by the way, which is precisely why the DNC leaks happened in the first place: Some Bernie Sanders supporters were so angry at the Clinton collusion and corruption, they decided to expose the DNC by handing over leaked emails to Wikileaks. The democrats only have themselves to blame for losing the election because the truth came out.

Lawless democrats have no respect for real democracy theyre pushing America toward a civil war they will quickly lose

What these tactics reveal is how lawless democrats have no respect whatsoever for the laws of this nation. Acting as crybullies and domestic terrorists, if they dont get their way, they threaten to shoot everybody who disagrees with them. (Sound familiar? Look up the history of Chinas Cultural Revolution.)

Thats the kind of behavior we see from totalitarian dictators in places like Cuba, North Korea or Communist China. And its perfectly aligned with the tyrannical philosophy of the political left: If they dont get their way, they threaten to kill everyone who opposes them.

Ive got news for those who espouse such threats of violence, coercion and lawlessness: We the People will stop you by invoking the Second Amendment to protect the Republic. And after we stop you, we will imprison you and charge you with crimes of treason. From there, the courts can decide what punishment is appropriate for your crimes.

Once President Trump is sworn into office, I hope he unleashes a massive investigation into all those who made death threats against the electoral voters. Those individuals must be arrested, imprisoned and charged with serious felony crimes, including sedition. Putting a gun to the heads of electoral voters is a very serious thing. It threatens the sanctity of the entire Republic. Such threats cannot go unpunished.

Hey, we can finally put all those FEMA camps to good use!

In observing all this, Ive come to realize the radical left is going to push America into a civil war. But I also believe a civil war wont last very long because the left will be very quickly defeated by a combination of police, military and armed American patriots fighting alongside law enforcement.

It turns out all those FEMA camps will come in handy after all: Thats where we can put all the left-wing terrorists and traitors who tried (but failed) to overthrow the country. There, well pump in broadcasts of Sean Hannity and Michael Savage until we break the NLP hypnosis programming the left-wingers have been subjected to for the last eight years under Obama, a master of linguistic subterfuge.

Over time, some of them might be rehabilitated to the point where they can rejoin society as sane, rational citizens instead of the mentally ill crybullies they are today. After all, we want to help these people heal their mental illness wherever possible. Unlike the radical left which wants to kill everyone they dont agree with, conservative Americans are far more interested in saving lives and uplifting our fellow brothers and sisters, no matter what sort of psychological trauma they were subjected to by CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times.

Remember: The same kind of psyop the media is running right now against the electoral voters has been pursued for years against liberals and progressives. Thats why they are so traumatized by reality: Theyve been poisoned, programmed, hypnotized and traumatized by the left-wing media for as long as they can remember!

Its time to finally set all Americans free from the psychological prisons that have been built for them by the corrupt political left. That effort begins anew on January 20, 2017, which is precisely why the radical left is planning to stage a mass uprising on that day. They last thing the left wants is Americans who arent subjected to a daily dose of left-wing propaganda.

Pro-Cruz Robocall Warns Nevada Voters of Impending Missile Strike,"CARSON CITY, Nv.  A robocall dialed out to hundreds of thousands of conservative voters on Tuesday warned of an imminent missile strike on several cities in Nevada, including the state capital, Carson City. The call prompted a mass evacuation of potential Republican supporters from the state and has been blamed for at least twenty-five deaths.

Just hours before the start of Nevadas Republican caucus, potential voters received a forty-five second prerecorded phone call informing them that New York, Washington, and Los Angeles had just been obliterated by ballistic missiles. Evacuation orders have been issued for your state, the call calmly explained. You are to immediately report to your precincts designated polling center for further instructions.

The vast majority of those who received Tuesday afternoons robocall -perhaps out of fear of nuclear annihilation- didnt stay on the line long enough to find out that the call had been paid for by Ted Cruz for President and, according to the Texas senators campaign manager, was meant to merely warn voters of the dangers of a Trump presidency.

In an interview with MSNBCs Chuck Todd, Senator Cruz said that such calls are common during primary season and accused his fellow candidates of forming a behind-the-scenes alliance in order to conduct a dishonest and misleading smear campaign against him. The senator expressed sadness over the tragic loss of at least two-dozen potential voters who perished trying to flee a fictitious Nevadan Hiroshima but blamed his rivals for taking parts of the call out of context in order to discredit him at the expense of the good people of Nevada.

Meanwhile, statements released by the Trump and Rubio camps called for a complete redo of the Nevada caucus. While Senator Rubio accused Cruz of denying people their constitutional rights; Donald Trump complained that Cruzs deceptive tactics had likely cost him millions of votes.

The Nevada caucus marks the final GOP primary leading up to Super Tuesday on March 1st.",F

"WIKILEAKS DOCUMENTS REVEAL APOLLO PROGRAM WAS A FRAUD, MOON LANDINGS NEVER HAPPENED","New documents scheduled to be released this week by Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, could reveal damaging information about NASAs Apollo program, believe experts.

Julian Assange, who has lived at Ecuadors London embassy since June 2012 in fear of being extradited to the United States to face espionage and conspiracy charges arising from the leaking of thousands of secret diplomatic and military documents by US Army private Chelsea Manning, has announced that he will release incriminating evidence that the government of the Unites States of America and NASA have hidden the truth about the Apollo program and the lunar landings for more than 40 years.

 These documents reveal the true reason behind the Apollo program deception and how this all played out in the Cold War strategy of the government of the United States at the time 

 Julian Assange, Wikileaks founder

The documents are said to have been handed to the WikiLeaks founder by a retired high ranking official of NASA that has worked within the government for over 45 years, Assange told reporters.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is about to reveal documents that could prove the Apollo space program was an elaborate scheme to dupe the Russians into a space race that never occurred
Damaging information for NASA

The documents to be released this week could cause up a stir weeks after NASA has announced it is preparing for another moon landing mission in 2030.

These documents that have been entrusted to me come from a highly known and respected high ranking official of the U.S. government who desires to leave this as a testament to the world before he dies. His desire is to stay anonymous as to not embroil his family and friends into a major polemic that could possibly destroy their lives he told reporters.

How Obama Used The DOJ To Destroy A Reporters Life And Blanket Full Immunity Over Clinton,"A quick trip down memory lane causes a stumble over this gem from Obama. He was gearing up for his first run at the office of President and was spewing lies all over the American public.



Ill make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the peoples business.

He is finally living up to that with less than a month left to his Presidency. He is not bothering to hide the dirty business he conducts, because he just doesnt care anymore. Recent months aside, everything that Obama pledged regarding transparency was smoke and mirrors.

Many are speculating that he will step up and stop talking about the Hillary email scandal and simply pardon her from any prosecution. It is in his best interest to do so. His attempts to marginalize the issue by nitpicking the statutory categories of confidential, secret and top secret by commenting that theres classified and then theres classified were not successful. He then took up the Clinton rhetoric of Russian spies. Since emails from the President to the unsecure Clinton email were found, it is likely that he will try and end the scandal while he still has the power to do so.

A reporter with first-hand knowledge sums up Obamas transparent government, Obama and his team criminalized reporting, becoming the most secretive White House since Richard Nixon.

A message on the White House website from Obama makes it clear he still maintains the illusion that his office upheld the pledge of transparency;

My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government.  We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.

Every action taken by Barack Hussein Obama was calculated. He knew, as did his advisors and supporters, that he was actively engaged in deception against the United States. David Axelrod was the Chief Strategist for both of Obamas campaigns. He also served as Senior Adviser to the President until 2011.

He was positioned to not only witness the secrecy that Obama demanded but he was also part of it. After leaving the Obama administration, Axelrod began to hint that things were quite different if we only looked below the surface.

Some of his revelations regarding Obama continue to come as a shock to people who the President painted with the colors of truth.

Obama lied about his support FOR same-sex marriage before announcing his support for it in 2012. Yet if Obamas views were evolving publicly, they were fully evolved behind closed doors, Axelrod writes. The president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed.
Obama chewed out Maureen Dowd on the campaign plane during the 2008 campaign. No one got under Baracks skin more than Maureen  He was patronizing and disrespectful. This is a direct contradiction to the calm, composed, Obama that Axelrod had helped to portray. He even lashed out at Axelrod.
Obama can have a short fuse, though he hides it from the public: The president called Axelrod a motherr and stalked out of a meeting after his strategist criticized the presidents debating techniques as Obama prepared for his 2012 debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney says Axelrod.
While those incidents speak to Obamas two-faced behavior, some of the secrecy of his administration can be summed up as simply lies;

Lie: Obama has told the world there has never been a better friend of Israel in the White House.

Truth: In September 2012, an Israeli newspaper reported that senior Obama Administration officials have told Tehran that Barack Obama does not intend to join Israel in any attack on Irans nuclear installations.

Lie: In May 2011, Obama said the fence between America and Mexico was basically complete.

Truth: The Department of Homeland Security admits just 36.3 miles or 5% of the border is fenced.

Lie: Obama lied and said abortions would not be publicly funded under Obamacare.

Truth: A March 2012 edict from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) unequivocally ruled Obamacare will use our tax dollars to fund abortion.

Ben Rhodes was Obamas partner in crime when it comes to one of the biggest lies of the administration; the Iran nuclear treaty. Rhodes, Obamas Deputy National Security Adviser, openly admitted his contempt for journalists, All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus. Now they dont. They call us to explain to them whats happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. Thats a sea change. They literally know nothing.

He later admitted more to David Samuels, a writer profiling Rhodes for a New York Times Magazine cover story; In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. We created an echo chamber. They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say. Rhodes was obviously not ashamed to display his contempt.

Fast forward to the present day and the new level of corruption that Obama reached when dealing with journalist James Rosen. In 2006, Risen published State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration. Unsurprisingly, President Bush did not take kindly to the book and his administration turned the whole situation into an investigation of government whistleblowers.

Risen was subpoenaed to reveal his sources, something he vehemently refused to do. He speaks about the attempt by Presidents to try and spin these stories; Well, they have gone after investigative reporting. They try to take, essentially, stories that they dont like, and try to find some classified information that might be part of that, and then turn it into a criminal leak investigation in which they say someone mishandled or disclosed classified information. As you know, you could do that with virtually any story in Washington.

Since then Risen has fought the Bush administration and then the Obama administration. In 2009, Obama took a rather unprecedented step of renewing a subpoena scheduled to expire that year. He was probably hoping nobody remembered that when in 2014 speech he told reporters; Here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.

In 2010, despite Risen keeping his sources confidential, the federal government indicted Jeffrey A. Sterling, a former CIA operative, with leaking the classified information to Risen. He continued his defiance, facing jail time, when the government ordered him to appear as a witness at the trial of Sterling.

Finally in January of 2015, after 7 years of uncertainty, the government decided not to call Risen in the trial. His fight for the truth had finally won.

Risen is a good example of how the Obama administration has fought the very ideas that he promised to uphold. It is very likely that we will see more insiders coming forward to open up about Obamas years in the White House. The truth would be a refreshing change.

A supporter of Risen, Jerry Kammer, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies, has this to say about President Obama;

He promised to be a different kind of president. But he has only suppressed efforts to disclose the governments misdeeds. His administration has been untransparent at so many levels.",F
BREAKING: 27 Classified Docs FOUND On Anthony Weiners Laptop Hillarys In TROUBLE,"The Clinton Machine is coming to screeching halt as 27 email chains containing classified information were found on Anthony Weiners laptop.

Expect the Congressional Republicans to grill Hillary Clinton, her aides, and the FBI for more information on the contents of the emails.

Fox News reports:

A federal court on Tuesday released the search warrant documents filed by the FBI to access a laptop used by disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, revealing new details about why the bureau revisited the email case just days before the presidential election.

The FBIs investigation found 27 email chains containing classified information on a laptop that was never authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information, according to the application for the warrant, which was partially redacted.

The October re-opening of the Clinton investigation sprung from an unrelated case involving Weiner allegedly sexting with an underage girl. During the course of that inquiry, agents discovered the joint laptop and later found emails addressed to and sent from Clinton.

"Just Days Before Leaving Office, Obama Gets News that Could INVALIDATE His Entire Presidency","President Barack Obamas legacy might soon be tarnished beyond repair. The long-awaited results from an in-depth investigation into Obamas past have just been revealed.

Barack Obamas birth certificate is a fake a complete forgery, and now evidence to prove it is headed to Congress. Arizona Sheriff Joe Apraios investigation into Obamas birth certificate found multiple inconsistencies, which could allow Congress to impeach the 44th president of the United States even after he leaves office, WND reports.

The forensic investigation into Obamas birth certificate reportedly proves the birthers were right all along! Jerome Corsi, Ph.D., a WND senior staff writer, is credited with forcing the Obama administration to release the document in the first place.

Corsis book, Wheres The Birth Certificate?, first brought the Obama birth certificate issue to the publics attention. The Constitution requires a presidential candidate to be a natural-born citizen but does not really define exactly what the entails  meaning even though Obama was born to an American woman, he still might not have qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

I was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child, Obama once said, according to a report by the Miller Center. Obama spent four years of his childhood living in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather.

Sheriff Joe Apraios forensic investigation into Obamas birth certificate revealed the document presented to the public appears to be identical to and copied from another birth certificate issued in Hawaii just several days after he was born. The exceedingly similar birth certificate reportedly belongs to Johanna Ahnee.

The items on the supposed Obama birth certificate, which appear to have been copied from the Johanna Ahnee birth certificate, include the word Honolulu, the word Oahu twice, two time stamps, and three different Xs. The identical appearance of the Xs was reportedly of particular interest to forensic investigators.

The Xs would have been placed on the original birth certificate documents by moving a typewriter carriage and rolling over the certificate at the same time. Investigators reportedly found it interesting that the stamp made by Alvin Onaka and the April 25th stamp might have been lifted from another document.

One of the expert forensic investigators who participated in the review of the Obama birth certificate was Reed Hayes. He is a court-qualified document examiner and handwriting examiner.

Reed Hayes also operates a business in Hawaii. He has been on the board of Scientific Association of Forensic Examiners for almost four decades. Forlabs, an Italian company which specializes in extracting details and information from multimedia files, produced the results of the Obama birth certificate forensic investigation.

We had two experts from two countries in separate disciplines of forensics that came to one conclusion: Barack Obamas long form birth certificate it not authentic, the report said.

Mike Zullo, the lead forensic investigator involved with the report, quoted details from the investigation by Hayes: The (nail in the coffin) that proves that Certificate of Live Birth is inauthentic is the exact lineup of numerous entries on both [certificates]. Zullo added the experts likened the evidence they found to prove the Obama birth certificate is a forgery to being as reliable as a fingerprint.",F
BREAKING: Hillary Clintons Nomination is a LIE and WE HAVE PROOF!!!!,"Hillary Clinton has reached the 2,383 delegates today. This is what she needed to win the party nomination for the 2016 Presidential race. She is officially the first woman nominee of a major U.S. political party. The Associated Press released a new count of her pledged delegates and showed that she has reached the magic number.

*** This is an outright lie.

Besides being suspiciously announced right before the California primary tomorrow. A spokesman for Bernie Sanders, Michael Briggs said Monday that the number that was released today depends on superdelegates. This means that this is not an official victory.

It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgement, are ignoring the Democratic National Committees clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer, he said.

*** What else would you expect from CROOKED Hillary?



Briggs says that Sanders could potentially change the minds of those superdelegates before the Democratic Convention.

Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination, he said. She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then. They include more than 400 superdelegates who endorsed Secretary Clinton 10 months before the first caucuses and primaries and long before any other candidate was in the race.

Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump.

The Clinton campaign tweeted the following:

In another recent tweet, Clinton said that we are on the brink of a historic moment, but we still have work to do.

We can agree with that statement. We are on a historic moment and Hillary Clinton is about to get SHREDDED by Donald Trump in the worst presidential sweeps in history. (h/t The Blaze)",F
Russian President Vladimir Putin Appoints Steven Seagal as Tsar of Crimea,"MOSCOW, Ru.  During an extravagant ceremony at the Kremlin on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he has appointed American actor and martial arts expert Steven Seagal to serve as Tsar of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula that was annexed by the Russian Federation in March of 2014.

Dubbed Steven the Great by Mr. Putin, the sixty-four year-old Under Siege star will take up residence at the Grand Livadia Palace in the coastal city of Yalta where he will hold power over nearly two million Crimeans. Featuring a breathtaking panoramic view of the Black Sea, the royal residence once served as a summer retreat for Nicholas II, the last tsar of Russia.

This is a momentous day, not just for the people of Crimea, but for all Russians, proclaimed Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev during an appearance on the state-run news network Russia Today. Steven the Great is a legendary martial artist with an extensive background in firearms and marksmanship. Furthermore, he is more proficient and possesses far greater experience in hand-to-hand combat, counter-terrorism operations, and crime fighting than any man on earth excluding His Excellency President Putin.

The prime minister later said Putin has the utmost confidence in Seagals ability to rule Crimea, calling the star of Hard to Kill a firm but gentle leader who is well versed in the art of paternalism. To drive the point home, Putin will hand over command of Russian forces in Crimea  including the Black Sea Fleet based in Sevastopol  to Mr. Seagal upon his arrival at Livadia Palace later this week.

Steven Seagal, who has appeared in a number of martial arts-style action films including Above the Law, On Deadly Ground, and Exit Wounds, was awarded Russian citizenship last Thursday by President Vladimir Putin, who issued a special decree honoring the actor.

30-day warranty expires on Make America Great Again baseball caps,"The warranty on Make America Great Again baseball caps has expired 30 days after the US election, meaning they are now falling to bits with startling rapidity.

The hats enjoyed a brief vogue in the United States last month, which resulted in them being cheaply mass produced and shipped from China in huge numbers.

However, as a month has now passed the warranty has run out and the hats are already looking worn, frayed and cheap, although it has been named headgear of the year by Time magazine.

Purchasers have reported the peak falling off the cap, the colours rapidly fading, and the whole thing being revealed as an attractively marketed piece of tat designed to last only until voting was over.

Some of the letters done gone fell off of mah cap so now it just says Make Merica Eat Again, our correspondent Simon-Bob Williams told us.

Which sounds like plum humdiggity good advice to me. Its what I sure live mah life for.

Eee-lection? What are yall still talkin about that for? It was weeks ago!",F
Another Person Investigating The Clintons Turns Up Dead,"Today, a young woman working for an anti-child trafficking organization was laid to rest.  Her name was Monica Petersen, and she turned up dead in Haiti on Sunday after posting I Found A Smoking Gun on social media.  Her friends and family are calling foul as her family cannot get believable information from Haitian authorities, and Ms. Petersen just happened to publicly post some reports that implicate the Clintons involvement in alleged human trafficking via a mine run by Hillary Clintons brother Tony Rodham.

A compilation of the various threads from reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Imgur and more can be found on the Reddit The Donald page here.


Go figure.  Just like any number of people either close to the Clintons or investigating them who could possibly end up a material witness during a trial, Ms. Petersen ends up dead.  This, for those following the fake news propaganda coming out of globalists, leftists, and the disgraced legacy media, is why there is a Clinton Body Count.  Monica Petersens name may well be added to it.


According to several reports, Haiti has been a nexus for child trafficking for a number of years.  In fact, found in the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks from John Podestas email account, information surfaced that Hillary Clinton assisted a Haitian woman, Laura Silsby, known to be involved in child trafficking in 2010 when she was caught trying to take 33 children  not orphans  out of Haiti.  The two womens history is known to reach back at least fifteen years.  Also in the Podesta emails are several archaic conversations about pizza that have taken on the aura of internet lore (what some call conspiracy theories) known as #pizzagate, and reportedly is the tip of the iceberg in an international child trafficking ring.

The rabbit hole gets very deep when one considers how many times Bill Clinton is known to have traveled Jeffrey Epsteins private child molestation island.

Did Monica Petersen get too close? A tenacious young woman investigating one of the most egregious crimes any human can commit, if she got too close to the criminal element and was known to them, it is a definite possibility.  A good friend of hers named Bella claims she found out what happened and is refusing to elaborate on public next-pagemessaging boards.  Whatever the case is, the people around the Clintons and those investigating them sure do tend to end up dead.",F
"Moments After Being Briefed on Berlin Attack, Obama Hops on Golf Cart","President Obama headed to a golf course moments after receiving reports that a truck had plowed through a Christmas market in Berlin in a potential terrorist attack, according to White House pool reports.

Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii for the holidays, was also briefed by his national security team on the assassination of Russias ambassador to Turkey just before departing for the Mid-Pacific Country Club.

White House press liaison Eric Schultz wrote in a memo that Obama left his rental vacation home at 10:21 a.m. HST, or 3:21 p.m. EST, after a press van held at the house for 11 minutes awaiting the president.

Spectators on the street threw shakas and recorded photos or video on cell phones as the motorcade made the 10-minute drive to Mid-Pacific Country Club, where the president will be golfing under cloudy skies, Schultz wrote, according to Mediate.

Nine people were killed and at least 50 others were injured in the Berlin truck attack. Police believe the incident was deliberate.

Russia, meanwhile, declared the killing of Ambassador Andrey Karlov in Ankara an act of terrorism.

The president has faced scrutiny for his decisions to golf during crises.

In August, the former FEMA Director Michael Brown, who oversaw the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, condemned Obama for continuing to golf during his two-week vacation on Marthas Vineyard while historic floods were devastating parts of Louisiana.",F
"REVEALED  Harry Reid Made a HUGE Mistake Right Before Leaving Congress, Its DEVASTATING","Once, Harry Reid pushed through the nuclear option to thwart the Republicans from representing their constituents. That very move is now coming back to haunt his Liberals peers just as Reid makes his long overdue exit from Congress.

He was warned that he and his fellow Democrats would one day regret this, but the arrogant Nevada Senators ignored the sound words of advice.That day has now arrived. The nuclear option will allow the Republican-controlled Senate to turn bills into law by a simple majority of 51 votes and not the super majority which requires 60 votes of approval, as Biz Pac Review notes.

Harry Reids nuclear option requiring only 51 votes to pass measures in the Senate coincided with exactly the number of seats Liberals held at the time. Now, the Republicans control both the House and Senate  which will allow them to easily pass all of the items President-Elect Donald Trumps agenda, if the career GOP politicians have the nerve, of course.

Should any GOP Senators jump ship and a rare tie occur in the Senate, Trumps agenda will still survive a nuclear option vote. Vice President-Elect Mike Pence holds the tie-breaking vote!

At least in public, Liberals are not willing to admit they are kicking themselves over following Harry Reids urgings on the nuclear option vote. At the time, Reid claimed the extreme rule change was necessary because the GOP was engaged in unprecedented obstruction.

Apparently saying NO! to  economically unfeasible Obama dictates is obstruction. The Republicans were following the Constitution and doing the job they were elected by We the People to do  which they can now do even more easily thanks to Harry Reid.

If Republicans want to go on record supporting radicals, thats their decision and they will have to live with it, Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Sen. Reid, said. If its radical to put Americans first, than so be it.

Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley claims he has absolutely no regret, over Reids nuclear option. Charles Schumer, the incoming Senate Minority Leader, doesnt appear to have been all that eager to accept the nuclear option.

Schumer reportedly wanted to keep the super majority vote threshold for both cabinet and Supreme Court appointments. Either his peers in the Senate did not share his concerns about the future when Republicans would be back in power, and felt Liberals would always be able to maintain a majority in the Senate, or were just too afraid of Harry Reid to vote against his plan.

One Liberal Senator, Richard Shelby from Alabama, tried to warn his fellow Democrats they were engaging in short term thinking when voting in favor of the nuclear option. They ignored his wise words as well, and totally ignored the big picture when placing their votes.

Democrats wont be in power in perpetuity. This is a mistake  a big one for the long run. Maybe not for the short run. Short-term gains, but I think it changes the Senate tremendously in a bad way, Senator Shelby said before the vote was taken in 2013.

Following both the text and the spirit of the Constitution while putting America and Americans first, would only be considered a radical concept by Liberals who have sipped far too much of the Kool-Aid handed out by the members of the politically correct far-left contingent in Washington.

Democrats will now be at the mercy of Donald Trump and the elected public servants across the aisle for at least the next four years and they have only themselves to blame!",F
"President Obama, Jon Stewart to Moderate Fifth GOP Debate","NEW YORK, Ny.  During a Democratic fundraiser in New York last Monday, President Barack Obama announced he has signed a contract with CNN to co-moderate the fifth GOP debate with former Daily Show host Jon Stewart. Set for December 15th in Las Vegas, Nevada, the debate is tentatively focused on foreign policy.

They need a little touch of reality, the president said, receiving a wide applause from the audience. This isnt an audition for the babysitters club, its the Oval Office. In the past, President Obama has publicly questioned whether or not the current Republican presidential hopefuls possess the intellectual and moral fortitude required to run the country.


Presidential debates shouldnt be centered around catering to the candidates comfort level, said CNN political analyst Melissa Cunningham, referring to the most recent CNBC debate which prompted a failed attempt by the GOP to harness control of future debates. Cunningham continued, Itll be interesting to see how they field questions from a seasoned politician, particularly one that knows the ins and outs of the job theyre vying for.

Meanwhile, former Vice Presidential nominee and reality TV star Sarah Palin railed against the Obama administration for once again trying to sandbag the Republican party and suggested the president might be better suited leading a morning call to prayer.

Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, who many speculate will play good cop to President Obamas bad cop during the debate, visited the White House this week to brainstorm possible debate questions with the president. Im told the meeting was very constructive, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday afternoon.

Fox News will host the fourth installment of the Republican presidential debates on November 10th in Milwaukee. Subsequently, the fifth GOP debate, featuring President Obama and Jon Stewart, is scheduled to air December 15th at 6 p.m. PST on CNN. The event will be held at The Venetian in Las Vegas.",F
HILLARYS POPULAR VOTE WIN CAME ENTIRELY FROM CALIFORNIA,"Since Donald Trumps electoral victory, supporters of presidential loser Hillary Clinton have cried foul after their candidate won the popular vote, yet failed to win.
On November 8, Trump was elected US president when he surpassed 270 electoral college votes.
Clinton didnt come close to winning the electoral college  232 to Trumps 304  but she did succeed in securing the popular vote, by about 2.8 million people.
But, If you take California out of the popular vote equation, then Trump wins the rest of the country by 1.4 million votes, reports Investors Business Daily.
And if California voted like every other Democratic state  where Clinton averaged 53.5% wins  Clinton and Trump end up in a virtual popular vote tie.
According to Investors, Trump easily won the presidency by every other metric even when California is included:

After clamoring that Trump would not accept the election results, butt-hurt Democrats have tried various tactics to steal and delegitimize his presidential victory, from calling for an end to the electoral college system, to implementing vote recounts  which backfired  to claiming the FBI rigged the election, to blaming fake news, a cartoon frog, Wikileaks, the alt-right and the Russian government.",F

BREAKING: Donald Trump Plan Secret Meeting With MOST POWERFUL BILLIONAIRE IN AMERICA!!!,"Donald Trump has requested to have a meeting with Charles Koch of the Koch Brothers to discuss his campaign going forward. Now I know some of you may be thinking But we dont want Donald in bed with the Kochs!

Well, hold on a second. This may be genius. You see, in reality, the Kochs WILL end up funding one of the 2 main party candidates, either Trump or Clinton. If Trump can ensure they do NOT support the Clinton campaign, he can effectively deprive her of billions while securing some for himself.



But thats not all. Unlike normal politicians, Donald Trump is not coming into the meeting absolutely NEEDING their cash. In fact, he has more than enough of his own to whoop Hillary Clinton back to 1967! This gives him what professional negotiators call a Power Position.

See, his popular support amongst the people and his own money mean that the Kochs NEED HIM if they want to maintain their corrupt empire and vast fortune. Since its not mutual, how could they say no?

So I am proud to see Donald Trump leveraging his position to build a war chest so MASSIVE that all the Clinton media ties in the world will not be able to stop the infinite momentum of the Trump Train.",F
"1 Thing Now Costing Hillary Everything, And The Best Part? She Designed It HERSELF","The Democrats thought they had the election in the bag. CNN, ABC, MSNBC, NYT, Huffington Post, and a whole host of other news stations were calling a big Trump loss from day one.

They had to eat their words when the American People showed up on November 8th to prove them dead wrong.

But What Happened Hillary?
We are all familiar with the countless leaks that performed catastrophic damage against the Democratic Party. But, in reality, all it did was show the lies, deceit, and corruption already taking place. Nothing that we saw is new, and it should be a bold wake-up call to anyone who believes what our government tells us without thought or question.

The #1 Reason For The Democrats Historic Loss
When the dust settled, however, it was clear that the Democratic Party created a wave they never saw coming; they never expected the American People to rise up by the thousands to declare their disgust for the Washington status quo.

How did they create this wave? Their initial strategy elevated Trump. They intended to use Trump as a Pied Piper candidate they would use to portray the Republican Party in a bad light. Their failed strategy was revealed in WikiLeak 1120.



Great job Hillary! Your attempt to put Conservatives in a bad light ended up backfiring big time. You didnt get to steal the Election. No, instead you awakened the ever-awake silent majority waiting to take back this great land.

So, thanks Hillary for being so, so pretentious and ignorant. Your historic loss will ring forever in American History as future generations will come to know you as one of the most corrupt and deceitful politicians ever.",F
Obama To Issue Executive Order Extending Presidential Term Limits,"WASHINGTON, D.C.  President Barack Obama will exercise his presidential powers this week when he signs an executive order directing the Supreme Court to indefinitely suspend the 22nd Amendment. Coming on the heels of the Conservative Political Action Conference held at Marylands National Harbor, President Obama announced his decision to temporarily end presidential term limits, saying, Im not seeing any potential presidential candidates on either side of the aisle who are capable of carrying out the task of running the country.

Citing poor performance on the part of a Republican-controlled congress, the struggling economy, and the continuing situation with ISIS, Obama said he feels obligated to continue his term in order to steer the country away from crisis just like Roosevelt.

This is not something out of the ordinary, says political analyst Elliot Stabler. We already have several states with no gubernatorial term limits. Connecticut, Idaho, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, New York, just to name a few. In fact Michael Bloomberg repealed term limits in order to run for a third time as New York City mayor.

In addition Mr. Obama has ordered the National Guard to remain on standby in the months leading up to and during his third term. He will issue a second executive order authorizing the Department of Justice to temporarily suspend Habeas Corpus in the event a state of emergency is declared due to opposition to his decision to continue the presidency.

The Twenty-second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified on February 27th, 1951 and sets a limit of two four-year terms for the office of the President of the United States. Since ratification there have been several unsuccessful attempts to repeal the 22nd Amendment. Most recently Democratic congressman Barney Frank and Senator Harry Reid introduced legislation to repeal presidential term limits. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell has sought to pass similar legislation. All three congressmen support Obamas decision to take on another term, which begins January 20th, 2017.",F
YOKO ONO: I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN THE 70S,"Los Angeles | Yoko Ono shocked reporters yesterday when she responded to a question concerning the presidential run of Hillary Clinton and the possibility that she could become the first woman President of the United States in American history.

The artist and widow of John Lennon, who is in Los Angeles to present a collection of cups and saucers she is exhibiting at the Museum of Modern Art, totally took reporters by surprise by admitting she had not only met the former First Lady at various times during a series of protests against the Vietnam War in New York in the 1970s but also knew her intimately.

The celebrity admitted laughingly to having a fling with her at the time and acknowledged her election would be a great advancement for LGBT and Women rights in America she added.

Yoko Ono shocked reporters when she admitted to ""having a fling"" with the former Secretary of State after they met during a protest against the Vietnam War in New York in the early 1970s
Hillary Clinton has been hit by a series of allegations of being a lesbian in her career which could ruin her bid for the presidency, believe some experts
Yoko Ono when asked about her thoughts about Hillarys run for the presidency completely took reporters by surprise.

We met many times during the New York Vietnam War protests in the 1970s, and became very intimate. We shared many of the same values about sexual equality, fighting against the authoritarian, patriarchal, male-dominated society we were raised in she explained.

We had a brief romantic fling when I lived with John in Manhattan and Hillary was studying at Yale, but eventually we lost touch. I am amazed how things are going well for her and wish her the best for her campaign she told reporters during the press conference.

Experts believe the statement could affect the presidential candidates bid for the presidency but previous allegations of Hillary Clintons lesbian past have not seemed to play against the front runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential race yet.",F

Anyone who follows this page will tell you that I painstakingly source my information. When I am wrong, I publicly admit it and post a retraction. That accuracy is one of the reasons that people follow this page.

Trump Takes Heat for 90 Minute Skype Session with Kim Jong-un,"President-elect Donald J. Trump received backlash from Democrats and members of the intelligence community on Thursday when it came to light that he engaged in a ninety-minute Skype video session last weekend with North Koreas Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Trump described the unprecedented discussion  which critics have called a clear violation of U.S. protocol  as extraordinary, saying the North Korean dictator appeared to be in very good health.

We had a wonderful conversation, the former reality TV star said of Kim. Hes very different from the way hes portrayed by the media and, you know, thats something I can relate to. Trump said he was surprised by exactly how much he and the Supreme Leader have in common. We both love meatloaf, Trump exclaimed. He said he eats it all the time. I said You ought to come to New York, Ill give you the best meatloaf youve ever had in your life.

Aside from sharing a love of baked ground meat, Trump and his North Korean counterpart discussed a wide range of issues including the economy, nuclear proliferation, and the reunification of North and South Korea. Trump, who repeatedly made the assertion during his campaign that more countries should have nuclear weapons, said he was willing to look into the possibility of loosening certain sanctions against the North Korean regime that might hinder the progress of its nuclear program. If they had that nuclear threat, Im sure it would be very good thing in terms of helping to unify the Korean peninsula, the president-elect said.

For his part, Mr. Trump said he offered praise for North Koreas single-party political system. I told him it was a very impressive thing to have such a successful political party that has lasted so long in that country. During his nearly two-hour long conversation with the Supreme Leader, Mr. Trump expressed an interest in implementing a similar single-party system in the United States as part of his effort to unite the country. I think it would be very good thing to have, said Trump, adding, Youd see a change in this country like you wouldnt believe.

Vice president-elect Mike Pence, who heads Trumps transition team, described the ninety-minute Skype session as very casual, telling The New York Times that its not unusual for world leaders to reach out following an election. This was the elected leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea  a democracy very similar to ours  offering his congratulations and good wishes, the vice president-elect explained. Mr. Pence said he believes the call will have little to no impact on U.S.-South Korean relations.",F

Bill Murray Kicks Off Presidential Campaign In South Carolina With A Bang,"Charleston, SC  Just one day after the Democratic Primary, legendary actor, comedian, and writer, Bill Murray, brought his newly announced Presidential campaign to Charleston, South Carolina, speaking to an estimated crowd of over 100,000 cheering fans and supporters.

Hello South Carolina! Are you ready to get weird or what? Murray said to the roaring crowd.

Murrays speech, which lasted a little more than an hour, touched on many issues from his campaign, including increased wages, health care, the cost of higher education and human rights in general. The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke.

I saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach, Murray told the crowd. Here are grown men, candidates running for President of the United States, and theyre acting like 4-year-olds. Theyre up there on stage, broadcasted to the entire world, calling each other names, interrupting each other, making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself; I think the American people deserve better than this. I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this.

Political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago.



I dont know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if hes just having some fun, but the man is making some excellent points out there. Hes getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it. I applaud Mr. Murray for what hes doing.

I pretty much dont like any of the candidates that are running for President right now, Murray told the crowd, I think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of em, are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion. Murray continued, Im always traveling around the world, but Im proud to call America, the good ole U.S. of A, my home. I think theres a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but theres also a lot of confusion and hate right now. People dont know what to make of these Hitler wanna-bes like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruzs, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And its sad that people go along with it, and cant see it for what it really is.

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.

We need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and cant be bought, Bradley said. I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; hes such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.

Murray finished the rally by saying, Im no hero, I just want to help out, and I hope you all choose to stand behind me, or beside me, or wherever is comfortable for you, but just as long as its with me. Look, we dont need to make America great again, because it already is; we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then thats sort of how youre supposed to live. Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible!

Murray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican, Democrat or Independent.

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money, Mikkelson said. The secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one, its actually quite simple. First, we start with the same cookie-cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk. Next, we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours. After that, one of our writers will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted. And now, last but not least, we slap a title on there similar to the articles headline that were debunking. This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story, and thats it! Then we just sit back and let the money roll in. We are the absolute definition of clickbait! Ill tell what, if it wasnt for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, putting out the stories that he does, my children wouldnt have been able to go to college. Holding back tears, Mikkelson finishes by saying, Though we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a fake news site, so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon.

Murrays campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March 2nd and then the Tempe Improv later that night. It is rumored Murray will be at the Improv meeting with locals and telling a few jokes. Tickets to that show are only $10.",F
Donald Trump Tweets Image Of His Penis  WARNING: Graphic Content,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but he just went to a whole new level this morning by tweeting what is supposedly an image of his private-parts. The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over 5,000 times.

The tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio and others about the size of Donald Trumps hands.

Look at those hands, are they small hands? Trump told the audience at his rally in Detroit back in March. And he [Rubio] referred to my hands, if theyre small something else must be small. I guarantee you theres no problem, I guarantee it.

Donald Trump's penis size
A screenshot of Donald Trumps tweet captured by ABC News just minutes before it was deleted.
Hes always calling me Little Marco. And Ill admit hes taller than me, Rubio told ABC News. Hes like 62, which is why I dont understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 52, Rubio said in Virginia on Sunday. And you know what they say about men with small hands? You cant trust them.

The New York billionaire has heard similar comments about his hands or, more precisely, his fingers, for years.

As Vanity Fairs Graydon Carter recalled online last year: Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a short-fingered vulgarian in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago.

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isnt surprised by Trumps actions.

Donald Trump is an ego-maniac, racist, bigot, who brings out the worst in the worst people, Bradley said. We get donations from poor people, the middle class and the upper class all the time. Since Donald Trump is the least charitable billionaire in the entire world, we expect no donations from that dick pic tweeting pervert anytime soon.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told reporters that he agrees with Trumps actions.

If everyone says you have a small penis, you dont keep it in your pants, you dont hide it; you prove them wrong! This is exactly what a real president should do! Praise Donald Trump! Praise Fappy!

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this about Donald Trump is accomplishing.

You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us. Mikkelson continues, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, Id say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.

Special Report: Obamas Bathroom Breaks Cost Taxpayers $4.1 Billion in 2015,"WASHINGTON, D.C.  According to a new report scheduled for public release this week by the Government Accountability Office, President Obamas bathroom breaks may have cost U.S. taxpayers just over $4 billion in 2015. Data provided to the GAO by the Obama administration shows that on average, President Barack Obama took 3.5 bathroom breaks a day last year, with each trip to the toilet lasting four minutes or less.

By the GAOs estimate, the commander-in-chief spent just over eighty-five hours in the bathroom in 2015 alone. The question on everyones mind when they look at a report like this is, What exactly is he doing in there?' Wondered Republican senator John McCain. The former POW admitted to C-SPAN that he goes to the bathroom about once a day on a good day.

Even so, the Arizona senator cited a particularly disturbing quote from the report stating that on October 23rd, the day former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, President Obama took a record-breaking twenty-one minute bathroom break. I think its very telling, Senator McCain said.

The average adult male uses the restroom anywhere from three times a day to once every three days, said Dr. Deepak Gupta, a senior scatologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. Ideally we see about one ounce of stool per every twelve pounds of body weight, Dr. Gupta explained, continuing, With that said, President Obama -who weighs about one hundred eighty pounds, should produce about fifteen ounces of solid fecal matter per bowel movement.

However, Dr. Gupta pointed out that due to unusually high levels of stress associated with the job of running the country, President Obama likely produces well below average stools. In all probability, the guy is a stool softener addict, Dr. Gupta told Real News Right Now.

Despite President Obamas low performance rating in the bathroom, the GAO estimates he still uses an above-average amount of toilet paper and -if hes a courtesy flusher, as White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest once hinted, he uses at least twice as much water per visit to the mens room as the average American. This, coupled with the obvious breaks in productivity, has cost taxpayers a whopping $4.1 billion.

This is simply unacceptable, Florida senator and GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. This is the kind of imprudent overzealous spending that I intend to do away with. Senator Rubio said he and other Republican congressmen -in an effort to save taxpayers a buck or two, often wear adult diapers while on Capitol Hill. Its uncomfortable but from a moral standpoint, its the right thing to do. We as elected officials owe that much to our constituents.",F
Obamas Racist Attacks Against White Working Class Caused Historic Democrat Party Collapse,"Since 2008 Obama and Democrats lost white working class voters across the US.

Middle class voters are Republican Trump voters.
Obama just sealed the deal with his anti-white racism.

The map below shows how Obama lost working class white voters in every state since taking office except for Vermont and Massachusetts.



New York Times

Democrats may have lost the white working class vote for generations.
Its Obamas fault.

And just this week Barack Obama was out again railing against white working class Americans for his partys woes.
iPatriot reported:

Obama also blamed Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and the NRA for distracting the country from his message of hope and change, particularly during the holiday season.

If were not actually out there changing the narrative like we are during campaigns, then folks in a lot of these communities, what theyre hearing is Obama wants to take away my guns, he said.  Obama is disrespecting my culture and is primarily concerned with coastal elites and minorities. Ah yes, the problem was you couldnt mindlessly brainwash the country Barack, not that your message was fundamentally anti-American.

Obama defended the robbers and hosted Black Lives Matter in the White House.

The Black Lives matter led to several police deaths, lootings and burned businesses.
Law-abiding white and black Americans have had enough.

Putin Goes On LIVE TV And CONFIRMS That Obama And Hillary Created ISIS,"Trump said that Obama had a hand in creating ISIS. Now that Donald Trump is the president-elect, Vladimir Putin, of all people, has confirmed this.

Putin said the Syrian rebels are mercenaries who only fight for whomever pays them more. While the president of Russia did not come out and say it is America arming them, he definitely, strongly hinted at it.



Of course, this is the type of flawed leadership we have come to expect under the Obama administration. Putins strong words have also, sadly, been confirmed by other sources.

A Wikileaks report last August proved that Hillary actually lied under oath when she was asked about the weapons trade program that occurred with Syria starting a year before the Benghazi attacks. In the batch of leaked emails, an astonishing 17,000 of them were about Syria alone, as per The National Review.

Something tells me this isnt the type of experience that the Clinton team was going for when they were squaring off against Trump, but this is also solid verification of Putins statement.

In Clintons attempts to win what would essentially have been a third term for Obama, she would have contributed to the international discord and unrest we have all become painfully aware of.

Lets get something absolutely clear: in a world where America is not dominant on the world stage and where ISIS is allowed to grow stronger, those who love freedom lose. Those who believe in all our countrys wonderful principles would soon see them slip away.

The United States of America simply could not afford to have more of the same. We, and the rest of the world, could not afford to have the ISIS rebels grow stronger and more organized. In the midst of all this, Donald Trump began to throw out massive truth bombs, including that Obama and Clinton created ISIS by virtue of their policies. This seemed incredibly outrageous to liberals.

However, credit Trump for being bold enough to say it. This is definitely the type of leadership we need. There is no question it is a sad day in America when it is Vladimir Putin who sounds more like an American than even our own sitting president. Thankfully, well soon have a true leader in the White House.

Seriously, Obama, this isnt a game. This is being the leader of the free world. Go back to your looney-tunes professor job and community organizing and quit playing leader!",F
URGENT: The Mainstream Media Was Hiding One HUGE Fact About Trump Win!,"Yall are gonna get a REAL kick outta this one. So remember how the Mainstream Media wouldnt shut up about Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump in the popular vote by 2.8 Million? Well, that is technically true, but they left out one MAJOR fact

IF YOU DISCOUNT CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK, DONALD TRUMP BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY MORE THAN 3 MILLION VOTES IN THE OTHER STATES!!



You see, Hillary Clinton managed to win the classic blue states (both of which have massive sanctuary cities) by 4.2 million in California and 1.8 million in New York.

In fact, by those numbers, it is safe to say that California alone is the ENTIRE reason Clinton won the popular vote and California does NOT speak for the entire country.

This is exactly why the electoral college exists, though. These 2 states do not account for the entire nation. They know NOTHING about the problems in places like Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Florida, all of which voted Trump. (H/T  Daily Mail)

Newt Gingrich brilliantly stated,

THIS IS FOOTBALL SEASON. A TEAM CAN HAVE MORE YARDS AND LOSE THE GAME. WHAT MATTERS IS HOW MANY POINTS YOU PUT ON THE BOARD.



So it looks like the brilliant system set up by our founding fathers worked out just the way it was supposed to.

Mark Zuckerberg: America Will Elect Its Next President via Facebook,"SAN FRANCISCO, Ca.  While speaking at the F8 developers conference in San Francisco this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a groundbreaking addition to the popular social media platform that many in the tech industry believe has the potential to revolutionize the American electoral process.

Were doing something thats never been done before, Zuckerberg declared. By allowing Americans to utilize Facebook to cast their vote in the upcoming presidential election from anywhere in the world using their desktop or mobile devices, were eliminating the conditions for which voter suppression can be implemented.

In the days leading up to the presidential election, Facebook users will be able to log into their accounts and find the profiles of each candidate prominently displayed at the top of their News Feed. Users can then cast their vote by Liking their desired candidates profile, Zuckerberg explained before adding, Its that simple.

Kathryn Blair, a senior official with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission  the federal agency which oversees state and national elections  said that Facebooks revolutionary new voting platform is projected to become a national standard by 2020. We aim to completely phase out the old-style paper ballots by 2018, Blair told CNNs Wolf Blitzer. In a very short time, all elections in the United States will be decided through Facebook. Ms. Blair later said the EAC is working with Facebook to reduce voter fraud by identifying and eliminating duplicate or otherwise fake accounts.

According to Zuckerberg, the upcoming U.S. presidential election is only the beginning for Facebooks innovative voting platform. In the not too distant future, Facebook will determine the outcome of elections all around the world. From the United Kingdom to Pakistan; to Ukraine, the Philippines and Israel, vowed Zuckerberg. Wherever democracy thrives, Facebook will be there.",F
Mysterious Manhattan Military Flyover Was Trump Rescue Exercise,"A military airplane and two huge helicopters doing loops over Midtown last week were conducting an emergency relocation planning mission in case they needed to extract President-elect Donald Trump during an emergency or attack, DNAinfo New York has learned.

The sight of the C-130 search-and-rescue aircraft and two HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters making passes over the heart of no-fly Manhattan for 40 minutes Tuesday, without warning or explanation, unnerved countless New Yorkers and tourists, many of whom took to Twitter and Facebook expressing post-9/11 concerns.

Sources told On the Inside that the flyovers were part of an emergency relocation drill designed to identify locations, primarily in Central Park, where a chopper could touch down near Trumps home inside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street, and safely evacuate Trump and others from the city.

BREAKING: Capitol Hill Shooter Identified as Right Wing Extremist,"WASHINGTON DC  On Monday afternoon, an extremist carried out an attack on Capitol Hill, shooting and injuring a police officer. The man has been identified as Thomas Finnigan, a white supremacist from Maryland. He has been taken into police custody, although currently Capitol Hill, including Congress and and the White House, remain on lockdown.



When the attack was carried out, Finnigan was described by eyewitnesses as trying to leave the visitors center, and advance further into either the library, Supreme Court, or even the White House.
All I heard was [expletive removed] Obama! [expletive removed] liberals and ISIS! Make America great again! John Burke, a college student visiting the visitors center stated to ABC News. Then we heard gun shots and were immediately instructed to leave the building.



Thomas Finnigan is a 32 year old white supremacist linked towards having a strong affinity for Republican frontrunner Donald Trump on his Facebook. He grew up in a lower class family in Tennessee, and later moved to Maryland. Not much else is known about the shooter.
Its concerning, how some of our own born-and-bred American citizens are turning into terrorists over political unrest, ABC political analyst Ana Cuddy said. While in my own opinion, I must say I take no issue with the conservatives of the United States in general, this is not the first time a Donald Trump supporter specifically has carried out violent acts towards other members of the population. It is concerning to see how the Republican party has radicalized, and I hope the United States of America can learn its lesson from the treacherous acts Trump incites in our citizens.

Today the Post was forced to add new notes to that article which essentially read that their list was crap and the source they claimed was reliable is actually just a bunch of Liberal morons.


Screenshot of editors note admitting that Washington Post published an unverified Fake News list.
Their source was an anonymous website called PropOrNot which said they had a obtained a list of people directly employed by Russia or idiots that repeat Russian Propaganda.

The beautiful irony is that the only website dumb enough to actually believe their list was the Washington Post. Do you know why? Because they are nothing but scam artists.

Let me break this down plain and simple for you folks. WaPo and other old news sources lost all of their Trust when they lied about the election this year. Of course, the problem goes even further back to when they LIED about Nukes being in Iraq.

Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The National Anthem At All Sporting Events Nationwide,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 14302, which makes it illegal to perform the national anthem at sporting events nationwide. Under the new order, it is now illegal to perform or recite the national anthem in any public venue. Because the anthem is primarily performed before sporting events, this is where the new order will have its biggest impact. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to 5,000 dollars and up to one year in federal prison.



The president said that his decision is a show of solidarity with the athletes who have been taking a knee during the anthem to protest police brutality. The President went on to say that the language used in the anthem is violent and hostile to African Americans.

If the recent protests by athletes like San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything, its that the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse. Our nation is being torn apart by a song, a song that is outdated and, jingoistic. Without swift action, we cannot move forward as a nation; we cannot heal the wounds of racial division. How can we expect our police officers to stop killing African Americans when the very song of our nation is one that glorifies killing?

Obama said that he would consider rescinding the order if Congress can come up with a politically correct version that more accurately reflects our changing values as a nation.

The days of the United States being a domineering world power that seeks to police the entire world through military force are coming to an end, Obama said. We need an anthem that reflects the nation we are becoming, not the nation we used to be.

It has now been over two months since Kaepernick was first spotted sitting down as the national anthem was sung at a preseason NFL game because he refused to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.

In a relatively short period of time, his protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States has captivated the country and sparked a debate not only about the state of race relations in America, but about what exactly it means to be a patriot.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of President Obamas decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in Novembers general election. She echoed his concerns about the anthems militaristic language and called it one of the last remnants of slavery.



Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had some harsh words for both President Obama and democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over the new Executive Order.

The hatred that President Obama and crooked Hillary have for this country really knows no bounds, Trump said at a press conference this morning in southern Iowa. I can tell you that when Im elected Ill have them both thrown in jail, and Ill make sure that they have to listen to the anthem in their jail cells all day long. I just hope we can stop them from rigging the election.

Chicago Cubs third baseman Paul Horner said that he will refuse to play until the Presidents order is reversed.

The national anthem is part of the game, Horner told ESPN. He might as well outlaw peanuts and crackerjacks. We always sing the anthem before we play ball, so if they arent going to sing the anthem, Im not going to play ball. I think youre going to find that Im not the only one who feels this way. Ive already got at least ten teammates who are ready to join me in a show of solidarity. I really think we can start a trend here.

The reaction to the new Executive Order has not been all negative, however. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who has himself taken a knee in protest of the National Anthem, called this A great day not just for African Americans, but for all Americans who value freedom. He said that encouraging people to sing a song that contains such blatant nationalism and militarism makes us no better than North Korea, and causes the majority of Americans to behave like a pack of rabid, mind-controlled zombies.

Obama also managed to garner the support of MLB commissioner Rob Manfred.

People like to watch sports because they provide a distraction from their day to day lives. the commissioners office told CNN via e-mail. There no need to taint that with political statements. I applaud the Presidents leadership on this difficult issue.



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.

This is a story about President Obama banning the National Anthem at sporting events around the country, Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN he disagrees with the President

What the President really needs to do is put a ban on masturbation in this country. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then well burn in Hell for eternity.

While Executive Order 14302 is likely to be challenged in court, experts say it could be tied up for years, meaning that it is unlikely to be reversed before it takes effect on December 1st. In the meantime, they say to expect numerous protests from those who disagree with the presidents decision.

The Obama Administration has set up a special 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns regarding the new Executive Order. The number for the hotline is (785) 273-0325.",F
ALERT  Trump Issues AMAZING Response to Bill Clintons Disgusting Insults,"Donald Trump is responding to Bill Clintons statement in a very presidential way, giving the American people the truth as opposed to the Democrats lies.

Bill Clinton stated that Trump knows how to get angry, white men to vote for him, and Trump responded by saying that Hillary Clintons campaign focused too much on the wrong states, as per Fox News.

Hillarys husband and the rest of the Democrats are pointing fingers everywhere except for at Hillary Clinton, who deserves it.

The fact of the matter is that she ran a terrible campaign, and thats why she lost. You would think she would have done so much better, due to the fact that this wasnt her first rodeo, but it bombed. It was DOA. Dead. On. Arrival.

Regarding Bills statement that Trump called him after the election, Trump clarified that it was Bill Clinton who called him and offered a very nice congratulations. Donald Trump was elected because he ran a very successful, if unconventional, campaign.

It was because of its unconventionality that it was so successful. The Trump campaign was a breath of fresh air to the American people, who were tired of the same old rickety career politicians who are dusted off and paraded around for the people to see.

Hillarys campaign did focus on the wrong states and barely made any appearances. Donald Trump hopped from state to state, practically killing himself to make several appearances and running himself ragged to prove to the people he was their best choice.

She failed to focus on states like Arkansas and states in the Midwest. She probably viewed them as beneath her and not worth her precious time. She was so sure that she was going to win that she didnt even bother trying to sell herself in enough states.

The Clintons lost because of her and her campaigns mistakes, but who do they blame? They blame people like FBI Director Comey for reopening the investigation into Hillarys email scandal 11 days before the election, which did hurt her numbers.

But frankly, if youre going to complain about that, then try not performing illicit actions with government property and maybe you wont be in the situation in the first place. Its as simple as that, but the Democrats refuse to not think of themselves as victims.

Donald Trumps response to Bill Clinton was absolutely perfect, and even more so because he put it on Twitter and sent it directly to the American people. Trump doesnt wait for the mainstream media to twist his wordshe delivers them himself.

Trump is our president-elect, and he was confirmed as the next president by the Electoral College on Monday. So, all the effort that liberals put forth to prevent this was for nothingthey have, once again, failed. They can point fingers all they want and play the blame game, but it wont change the outcome that Trump is the president, and Hillary Clinton is not.",F
TRAITOR-IN-CHIEF: Heres The SICK REASON Newt Gingrich Just Betrayed Donald Trump,"Newt Gingrich has been waging an INSANE jihad against Donald Trump over the Mexican Judge comments made earlier in the week.

The mainstream media reported earlier last month that Sheldon Adelson was willing to contribute $100 million to Trumps campaign. It was not reported much, but there was another $100 million that was offered to Trump if he picked Newt Gingrich. Thats why Gingrich was so nice to Trump.



When Trump the entire offer.declined the entire offer. Gingrich started lashing out at him publicly. He even recently claimed that the comments Trump made about the judge were one of his worst mistakes. All Trump did was point out publicly that the Trump University lawyer has ties to the La Raza Hispanic nationalist organization.

I DONT KNOW WHAT TRUMPS REASONING WAS, AND I DONT CARE, GINGRICH TOLD THE WASHINGTON POST.

What a traitor. Its hard to see it happen because a lot of people were hoping that Newt would be the VP. It is now showing that he is just bitter for having Trump change his mind.

Its in Trumps best interest to pick someone that identifies with him ideologically as his VP. This makes a lot of sense because Gingrich has done an almost complete 180 since last week. But, we shouldnt be too torn up about it  remember that Newt Gingrich wanted a moon base at one point.

New Study Shows Illegal Immigrants to Outnumber Americans 2 to 1 by 2025,"CAMBRIDGE, Ma.  A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at MIT suggests Americans living in the United States could find themselves outnumbered by illegal immigrants by a staggering ratio of at least two to one within the next ten years unless significant changes are made to U.S. immigration policy.

If we continue traveling at our current trajectory, we as Americans will soon become a minority in our own country, warned Dr. Emilio Martinez. Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office, Dr. Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a ten-year period. What weve seen is an incremental increase of twenty-three per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border.

The U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will reach just over 345 million people by 2025. However, according to Dr. Martinez, the current data doesnt factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year. Our models show that if this trend continues, the population of the United States by 2025 will reach approximately 621 million with just under forty-nine per cent consisting of American citizens, Martinez explained, adding that the data is offset by a 2% margin of error.

In contrast, the population of Mexico, which currently rests at about 126.3 million, is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due, in part, to rapidly changing climates and the countrys ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers. Mexicans -as weve seen over the last quarter century  have already begun to emigrate north into the U.S. and Canada, said Luis Garcia, a third-year statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr. Martinez. These numbers, while relatively small, are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades.

Garcias data shows that by 2050, a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, could see their populations dwindle below 2.5 million. These people arent simply disappearing, said Garcia. On the contrary, theyre coming to the United States.",F

"OTTOMANS WERE THE FIRST TO REACH THE MOON, SAYS TURKISH PRESIDENT","Istanbul| Ottomans were the first to walk on the surface of the moon, not Neil Armstrong, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, yesterday, during an iftar (fast-breaking) dinner hosted by the Turkish Green Crescent.

Mr. Erdogan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than 300 years before the beginning of the Appolo program, vowing to build a mosque in the crater where they landed.

It is alleged that the first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong in 1969, Erdogan said. In fact, Muslim space explorers reached our satellite 334 years before that, in 1635. Everyone knows the story of the famous aviator, Lagri Hasan elebi, the Ottoman Rocket Man, who made the first successful manned rocket flight in 1633. What you might not know, is that he attempted to reach the moon, two years later, and could very well have succeeded!

The story of Lagari Hasan elebi was purported by a famous 17th century Arab merchant and traveller, Mehmed Zilli, also known as Evliya elebi. In his famous travelog, he explains that Lagari Hasan elebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5 kg or 140 lbs) of gunpowder. It took off from Sarayburnu, a site below the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.

As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launch O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus!, before lighting the rockets gunpowder.  He then ascended more than 200 meters in the air and landed in the sea, hundreds of meters from his takeoff point. Swimming ashore, he allegedly reported: O my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you!.

This 17th-century engraving depicts one of Lagri Hasan elebis famous rocket flights, but its unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon, in 1635.
President Erdogans surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience, a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician. He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims, adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims.

Why do you not believe it? Because youve never believed that a Muslim can do such a thing, just like youve never believed that our ancestors could manage to launch ships in the Golden Horn after transporting them across land, Erdogan said, referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet IIs conquest of Istanbul in 1453. This claim is not new. A number of academics in Turkey and in the rest of the world have made this claim, and I believe they are right. NASA may have destroyed most of the physical evidence of the Ottomans success during the Apollo 11 mission, but well try to find any evidence that might have escaped the cover up.

The Turkish President did not, however, give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather them.

The description of the flying engine used by Lagri Hasan elebi is pretty vague and doesnt really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design. This sketch shows the basic design as it is described, but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurate.
The story of Lagri Hasan elebi is considered a legend by most historians, and most experts believe that it is impossible that the aviator could have survived a flight into outer space.

His first flight was, indeed, addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November 11, 2009, in the episode Crash and Burn.  The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely, however, to Evliya elebis descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the period;

The team noted that Evliya elebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagri Hasan, but concluded that it would have been extremely difficult for a 17th-century figure, without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. This conclusion was backed by the fact that, although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded in midflight",F
20 Black Lives Protesters Claim They Were Jumped By 4 Trump Supporters  Is It a HOAX?,"Twenty millennial snowflakes want us to believe they got beat down by FOUR Trump supporters. And these alleged victims have ZERO evidence to support their claims.

Peter Soeller, a New York City student and civil rights activist, tweeted that he and approximately 20 of his pals were attacked by Donald Trump supporters after they left a party on Saturday night, BizPac Review reports. According to Soeller, his buddies were merely walking down the street chanting and laughing when four or five Trump supporters suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

The Trump supporters confronted us and assaulted us yelling, Blue Lives Matter Get out of my country, calling us faggots and commies as they wailed on us, Soeller tweeted. So, there were 20 millennials on their way home from a Black Lives Matter party and not a single one of them had a cellphone to whip out and take a few seconds of video of the alleged beating?

Millennials are rarely ever separated from their phonesdoing so could lead to them missing the chance for yet another inane selfie. It is beyond illogical to think 20 college kids would leave for a night out and not one of them had a working phone.

Soeller and his friends were on their way home from the Decolonize This Place party when they were allegedly stopped by a small handful of Trump supporters. Soeller claims he and two others were the most seriously injured.

No more pettiness, time to organize, Soeller also said in his tweet. He claimed the roving mini horde of Trump supporters were trolling the streets looking for queer anti-Trump activists.

The anti-police activist also made a baseless claim about the four or five attackers who supposedly beat up the 20 millennials. Soeller claimed the Trump supporters were off-duty cops.

Why did Soeller leap to such a wild accusation? The build of the attackers and the way they took us down, convinced the college student the unknown men had to be police officers.

Trump supporter attack stories appear to be all the rage since the election. The elusive Trump fans wander around city streets in search of millennials to whomp on  at least that is what the snowflakes claim.

One such story has already been debunked. A Muslim college student who claimed she was attacked by Trump supporters who hurled Islamic slurs at her was actually just trying to stay out of trouble with her strict parents.

The Muslim girl had stayed out too late in the evening with her boyfriend and needed a sympathetic story to tell the folks. She went into great detail when describing the alleged attack to police officers, who quickly realized far too many holes existed in her tall tale.

Well just have to wait and see if such holes start piling up in this case. Im sure the involved police officers will be paying extra close attention in the case of this cop-hating agitator and his 20 friends, who couldnt take on four or five cop built guys.

Please share this story on Facebook and tell us what you think because we want to hear YOUR voice!",F
Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.



During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values.

The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is, Obama said. Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovahs Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this one nation under God, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying liberty and justice for all, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.

Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of under God runs afoul of the First Amendments establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects Americas values.

I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyones beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obamas decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in Novembers general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledges language and suggested that the pledges mention of God sends the wrong message to Americas children.

I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the presidents order, referring to the president as an illegitimate Muslim traitor.



As a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to ABC News about the ban.

This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools. Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.

Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obamas decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.

When our children are forced to chant, One nation under God, whose God are they referring to exactly? Ketchum said, From birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a childs involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values. Ketchum continued, This is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.

While Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.

Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a presidents executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.



Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.

It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then well burn in Hell for eternity.

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. Mikkleson continues, A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like umimumimaginative, recycled, hoax, saying that a story illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just outrageous accusations by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, thats a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences. Mikkelson further explains, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, its so funny! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. But we dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?

Originally composed by Colonel George Balch in 1887, The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress in 1942. The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in 1954 when the words under God were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan were taking place.

"Trump Pledges to End ""Let's Move"" on First Day in Office","Calling it a 'total disaster', president-elect Donald Trump pledged in a video clip posted on YouTube today that he will scrap Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative on his first day in office.

Launched in 2010 with a mission to combat childhood obesity by promoting exercise and improving access to healthier food choices for children in underserved communities, Let's Move has failed to achieve any of its goals, the president-elect claims.

""It's a total disaster. A complete joke. Kids today are fatter than ever,"" Trump said. ""Maybe vegetables make you fat. Who knows? We're going to look into it.""

Trump indicated his administration would replace the campaign with one that promotes jobs and economic growth.

""These kids don't need to play, they need jobs. Nobody's going to pay anyone to play hopscotch,"" he remarked. ""And not only is working a great form of exercise, it will help their parents pay the bills.""

Trump went on to say that he would work with Congress to have the provisions regulating child labor removed from the Fair Labor Standards Act, or simply repeal the entire law altogether in order to make way for his Get to Work initiative.",F

"ASSASSINATION OF RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR JUSTIFIED, LIBERAL JOURNALIST SAYS","A writer for the NY Daily News argued Tuesday that justice was served following the assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov.
According to Gersh Kuntzman, the murder of Karlov at the hands of a Turkish police officer shouting, Allahu akbar, and, Dont forget Aleppo, was not terrorism, but instead a noble act.
As Vladimir Putins man in Turkey, Karlov was the public face of that murderous dictators war crimes around the globe and of oppression at home, Kuntzman claims. Andrei Karlov is the human embodiment of policies that deployed bunker busters to kill babies, sent fighter planes on scorched earth bombing runs that destroyed a whole city, aided Syrian madman Bashar al-Assad in his campaign that has killed hundreds of thousands, and even ordered attacks on UN aid workers.
Kuntzman, who was surprised his murder didnt come months ago, attempted to draw comparisons to the 1938 assassination of Ernst vom Rath, the Nazi ambassador to France.
Like Karlov, Rath was the public face of atrocity  in this case, Adolf Hitlers genocide, anti-Semitism and coming global aggression, Kuntzman wrote, comparing Russias role in Syria to Hitlers across multiple continents.
After receiving backlash for the controversial piece, Kuntzman further defended his position on social media, arguing that Karlov was a soldier  therefore shooting him in the back outside of a warzone was an appropriate move.",F
"BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation, Pay to Play, Perjury","New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life, NYPD sources told True Pundit.

NYPD sources said Clintons crew also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders.

The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.

But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:

Money laundering
Child exploitation
Sex crimes with minors (children)
Perjury
Pay to play through Clinton Foundation
Obstruction of justice
Other felony crimes
NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the departments highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.

Whats in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach, the NYPD Chief said. There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.

The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.

People are going to prison, he said.

Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders  are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said.

If they dont cooperate they are going to see long sentences, a federal law enforcement source said.

NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said.

Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiners cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge.

The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epsteins island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.

Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epsteins guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

Laptop Also Unveiled More Classified, Top Secret Breaches

According to other uncovered emails, Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including Weiners unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington D.C.

Weiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweiner.com. Weiner, a former seven-term Democratic Congressman from New York, primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York City.

At one point, FBI sources said, Abedin and Clintons classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in Weiners email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shop.

However, Weiner and Abedin, who is Hillary Clintons closest personal aide, werent the only people with access to the Weiners email account. Potentially dozens of unknown individuals had access to Abedins sensitive State Department emails that were stored in Weiners email account, FBI sources confirmed.

FEC records show Weiner paid more than $92,000 of congressional campaign funds to Anne Lewis Strategies LLC to manage his email and web site. According to FBI sources, the D.C.-based political consulting firm has served as the official administrator of the anthonyweiner.com domain since 2010, the same time Abedin was working at the State Department. This means technically Weiner and Abedins emails, including top secret State Department emails, could have been accessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers of personnel at the Anne Lewis consulting firm because they can control where the website and it emails are pointed, FBI sources said.

According to FBI sources, the bureaus newly-minted probe into Clintons use and handling of emails while she served as secretary of state, has also been broadened to include investigating new email-related revelations, including:

Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiners email
Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails.
Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records
Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documents
A private consultant managed Weiners site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domains listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts.
Because Weiners campaign website is managed by the third-party consultant and political email guru, FBI agents are burdened with the task of trying to decipher just how many people had access to Weiners server and emails and who were these people. Or if the server was ever compromised by hackers, or other actors.

Abedin told FBI agents in an April interview that she didnt know how to consistently print documents or emails from her secure Dept. of State system. Instead, she would forward the sensitive emails to her yahoo, Clintonemail.com and her email linked to Weiner.

Abedin said, according to FBI documents, she would then access those email accounts via webmail from an unclassified computer system at the State Dept. and print the documents, many of which were classified and top secret, from the largely unprotected webmail portals.

Clinton did not have a computer in her office on Mahogany Row at the State Dept. so she was not able to read timely intelligence unless it was printed out for her, Abedin said. Abedin also said Clinton could not operate the secure State Dept. fax machine installed in her Chappaqua, NY home without assistance.

Perhaps more alarming, according to the FBIs 302 Report detailing its interview with Abedin, none of the multiple FBI agents and Justice Department officials who conducted the interview pressed Abedin to further detail the email address linked to Weiner. There was never a follow up, according to the 302 report.

But now, all that has changed, with the FBIs decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation and the husband and wife seeking immunity deals to testify against Clinton and other associates about the contents of the laptops emails.",F
"BREAKING  Rand Paul Stands Up For TRUMP, Says What All Of Us Were Thinking","The 2016 GOP nominating was definitely a slugfest. While Rand Paul would have made a decent nominee, he came out in support of a major policy of the man whos been called upon to lead our nation.

Lets not give in to Washington and its stagnated ways. Lets follow the lead of Presidents Reagan and Bush and help President Trump begin his administration with tax cuts for everyone and less money in Washington, Paul wrote in an op-ed for Breitbart.

We have tried it before, Paul wrote. In fact, the most successful Republican presidents (and a few Democrats) led off their agendas with tax cuts to send money back and to try to get government to live with a little less. 

Indeed, there have been two men who have shown how well tax cuts can play a role in stimulating our economy. These men were Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy.

When we elected the youthful Kennedy to become our 35th president, he had little economic experience, and the nation was still in the doldrums of a recession in 1958 that rivaled the one of 2008. He set out to determine how to get the country back on track.

As Lawrence Kudlow and Brian Domitrovic wrote in Time, in Kennedys first year in office, he at first tried the typical Democrat approach and instilled a number of spending approaches. However, growth was only at a stagnant 2.7 percent. He then had a change of heart and decided to push through a generous tax cut of 30 percent. 

Although Kennedy never saw it to fruition before he was assassinated, LBJ decided to push it through as a memorial to the fallen leader. The tax cut became law in 1964, and it started an uninterrupted run of eight years of consistent economic growth of at least five percent annually.

One of Kennedys other successors was a man named Ronald Reagan, who was intrigued by the Kennedy model of tax cuts. He devised his own plan, and it passed the Senate by a 97-3 vote in 1986. The nation enjoyed a long-term growth rate of roughly four percent per year.

In 2016, the economy is not completely bleak, but it could be much better. The nation has had stagnant growth for much of the last two presidents terms, but as Rand Paul noted, even when George W. Bush attempted a modest tax cut, it gave the nation a boost for a period of time.

In standing with Donald Trumps ambitious tax cut plans, Rand Paul is staying true to himself and to this model. Trump has proven so far that he is a person of his word, and his proposed tax cuts would give this country the prosperity it so richly deserves.

If Trump doesnt follow through and it is just a read my lips moment, he will probably be a one-term president. He has Pauls support, so hopefully we can get America back on the right path to making it, once more, Great Again.",F
REPORT: Nine ISIS Supporters Arrested Near Washington D.C.,"At least nine individuals have been arrested in Northern Virginia for attempting to support ISIS since the group rose to power in 2014, according to a report from law enforcement officials.

According to the report, which was obtained by The Washington Times, the nine individuals were arrested for providing or attempting to provide support to ISIS and included a police officer and several U.S. Army soldiers.

The Washington Times reports:

Law enforcement agencies have arrested nine Northern Virginia residents on charges of aiding the Islamic State since the terrorist group rose to power in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and launched social media propaganda to attract followers, a government message to police states.



Of the nine Northern Virginians who were arrested, all but one were in their teens and early 20s. They included a police officer, a Starbucks barista, Army soldiers, bankers and a cabdriver. Four of the nine graduated from Northern Virginia high schools, one with honors. Two attended Northern Virginia Community College.

According to the Times, one of the men, a U.S. army combat engineer named Mohammad Bilor Jalloh, attempted to purchase firearms in an attempt to carry out a Fort Hood style attack.

Another man, Metro police officer Nicholas Young, traveled to Libya and gave advice to Islamic State followers on how to avoid law enforcement monitoring according to law enforcement officials.

Several others planned on creating online propaganda for the terror group, with one seeking to encourage lone wolf style attacks on Washington DC.

The report raises new concerns about the reach of the terror group into the U.S. homeland, and any future plans to import new refugees from troubled Muslim nations.

ISIS Leadership Among Top GOP Campaign Contributors,"WASHINGTON, D.C.  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and other members of the Islamic States leadership council have provided more than five million dollars in campaign contributions to Republican presidential candidates this year, according to a campaign finance report released by the Republican National Committee last week.

According to the report, more than half of the GOPs leading presidential contenders including Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have received upwards of one million dollars from the Islamic State. However, specific standards set in place by the Federal Election Committee limit individual donors to a maximum contribution of $2,700 per year. In addition, the FEC strictly prohibits foreign nationals from making any sort of contribution toward elections held in the United States.

To the delight of the RNC, the Islamic State has found a convenient loophole to bypass these restrictions. Using the same global financial networks already in place meant to provide funding to its various terror operations, ISIS is able to funnel cash through a number of waypoints before it reaches sympathetic Americans residing in the United States. Then, using funds provided by the Islamic State, individuals simply write a check for the maximum donation allowed, payable to a presidential candidates campaign.

Its really an ingenious system, said James Arevalo, assistant campaign manager for Senator Ted Cruz. Obviously the senator doesnt see eye to eye with the Islamic State on some issues, Arevalo told CNN, continuing, That said, we certainly share very similar beliefs and values with ISIS, particularly when it comes to womens rights and gun control. Arevalo added that candidates have a moral obligation to meet the uphold the values of supporters and donors alike.

In the wake of the nations most recent mass shooting that left fourteen people dead and another twenty-two injured in San Bernardino, California, the Republican party, at the request of the Islamic State and the National Rifle Association, once again blocked legislation that would enact stricter gun control policies in the United States.

Currently there are an estimated 700,000 people on the U.S. governments terror watch list with several thousand residing in the United States. Legislation proposed by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein would have prevented terror suspects, felons, and individuals with a history of mental illness from purchasing firearms.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, who opposed the legislation, told CBS This Morning that the act of blocking suspected terrorists and convicted felons from legally obtaining firearms would infringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens.",F
Ted Cruz: I Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegal,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this The single most important issue facing the country today and that without swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction.



Self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because youve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. Im not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devils playground for good, Cruz said. Im asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think its safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.

Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.

Look, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isnt. To be honest, I dont know a lot about this subject matter. I dont need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and shes a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.

This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the states ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no Right to stimulate ones genitals. Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruzs former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruzs stance against stimulating ones own genitals was A new belief of his, implying that much of Cruzs time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruzs former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazins story.

All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldnt even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. Its absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching ones self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he cant do it anymore, then no one can.



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party.

It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President, Bradley said. With all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime. Bradley continued, Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.

Cruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devils doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, theyre big enough to handle it.

Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruzs call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11% of Trump supporters are against a ban.

RNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a no-brainer and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.

Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the partys Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us. Mikkelson continues, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, Id say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.

Regardless of which side Trump takes on the issue, it is certain to invoke heated debate on both sides of the political aisle. You can voice your opinion about Cruzs proposal by calling the Senators 24-Hour No Self-Love Hotline at (785) 273-0325.",F
North Carolina legislators to reconsider transgender bathroom bill,"RALEIGH, N.C.  Legislators who passed the North Carolina law known as the bathroom bill nine months ago head back to the capital on Wednesday to consider repealing it. But theres uncertainty over exactly what lawmakers will do, in part because this Republican-controlled legislature has shown a willingness to go its own way, despite intense outside pressure to scrap the law.

Legislators returned to Raleigh for a special session called by GOP Gov. Pat McCrory to eliminate House Bill 2 -- the bathroom bill -- which has been blasted by gay-rights groups and resulted in job losses and sporting event cancellations. 

No repeal bill backed by Republicans had been made public by midday. Instead, House Republicans returned to a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning that continued into the afternoon. They held a similar meeting that lasted for more than four hours Tuesday night. Some Republicans were unhappy after learning that Charlotte on Monday had not repealed its entire nondiscrimination ordinance, which had been the genesis of HB2, Republican repeal supporter Rep. Chuck McGrady said. 

On a difficult issue where the parties dont have a lot of trust, we got thrown a curveball by the less than full repeal by Charlotte, McGrady tweeted early Wednesday. 

The fact that McCrory called lawmakers back to Raleigh a month before their 2017 sessions start was challenged by an opponent of HB2s repeal. 

There is no extraordinary circumstance, said Rep. Jeff Collins, R-Nash, during a brief debate over session procedures, other than the extraordinary hubris of a city council telling us we have to act by a certain date. Mondays action by the Charlotte council was contingent on HB2s repeal by Dec. 31.  

Over the past year, there has been bitter fighting between Democrats and Republicans. Just last week, Republican leaders convened a surprise legislative session and passed two laws designed to bring Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Coopers powers in check when he becomes governor Jan. 1.

Cooper blasted McCrory over House Bill 2 during the governors race, and the fallout over the law  job losses, canceled concerts and sporting events  contributed to McCrorys narrow defeat. The wide-ranging law is best known for requiring transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildings.

GOP Rep. Chuck McGrady of Hendersonville supports repealing the entire law and said he believes a significant number of House members from both parties do as well.

Everybody is acting in good faith in my opinion, McGrady said. House Republicans met by phone Monday and would meet in person in Raleigh later Tuesday, he said.

However, lawmakers were already under pressure from some conservative groups to keep HB2 in place.

Were sending the message to our supporters that lawmakers should not now betray people who supported them and compromise common-sense principles like privacy, dignity and freedom from our citizens, said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition.

House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger have only issued a brief statement Monday, saying they would take up the repeal of HB2. They also criticized Cooper for taking too much credit.

They did not return messages for comment Tuesday.

Charlotte appears to have held up its end of the bargain, but the measure enacted Monday notes that its dependent on HB2 being repealed in its entirety by Dec. 31. That could give some lawmakers justification not to repeal it.

Cooper, who helped broker Charlottes cooperation with phone calls over the weekend, expects a full repeal, his spokeswoman Megan Jacobs said late Monday.

The law also limits statewide protections for LGBT people in public accommodation and employment, and it reinforced a prohibition on local governments from raising minimum wage. Local governments are also prevented from enacting nondiscrimination measures that would go further than state law.

The session is scheduled several days before Christmas, with some legislators out of town.

GOP Rep. Jeff Collins of Rocky Mount, who voted for HB2 in March, told The Wilson Times that he was not interested in repealing anything. I think we did the right thing the first time, he told the newspaper.

Passing a repeal would only require a handful of GOP support  perhaps 10 in the Senate or 15 in the House  if all Democrats voted for it.

Discussions about repealing the law increased after decisions by the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference to move their championship events out of North Carolina this academic year. The NBA also moved an All-Star Game out of Charlotte.

Democratic Rep. Grier Martin of Raleigh said until theres a full repeal, Im pretty certain that were not going to see another NBA All-Star Game or NCAA tournament game in North Carolina.

LGBT advocates said they were cautiously hopeful.

We are holding out hope that the legislators will keep their word, said Simone Bell, Southern Regional Director for the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal. We want complete and full repeal of HB 2.",R
Trump says nobody really knows if climate change is real,"President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that nobody really knows whether climate change is real and that he is studying whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year ago.

In an interview with Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, Trump said hes very open-minded on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President Obamas efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut Americas global competitiveness.

Im still open-minded. Nobody really knows, Trump said. Look, Im somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows. Its not something thats so hard and fast. I do know this: Other countries are eating our lunch.

There is a broad scientific consensus that human activity  including the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, heating and industrial manufacturing  is driving recent climate change. In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is extremely likely that, since the 1950s, humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the dominant cause of the planets warming trend. The top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal record-keeping began in 1880.

But its not the first time that Trump has disregarded that established scientific view.

During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to climate change as a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, a comment he later described as a joke. But during a town hall in New Hampshire, he also mocked the idea of global warming. At that event, Meghan Andrade, a volunteer for the League of Conservation Voters, asked Trump what he would do to address the issue, to which he replied: Let me ask you this  take it easy, fellas  how many people here believe in global warming? Do you believe in global warming?

After asking three times Who believes in global warming? and soliciting a show of hands, Trump concluded that nobody believed climate change was underway except for Andrade.

During Sundays interview with Wallace, Trump said he needed to balance any environmental regulation against the fact that manufacturers and other businesses in China and elsewhere are able to operate without the kind of restrictions faced by their U.S. competitors.

If you look at what  I could name country after country. You look at whats happening in Mexico, where our people are just  plants are being built, and they dont wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? he said. They build it like the following day or the following week. We cant let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.

The U.S. has outpaced the rest of the developed world in terms of growth since the 2008 recession, though developing countries such as China boast higher growth rates. Typically, economists compare the U.S. against other industrialized nations since developing countries typically grow faster than their developed counterparts.

The New York businessman made the same critique of the Environmental Protection Agency, to which he has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt  a climate change skeptic  as the head. Wallace asked whether he was going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy, to which Trump replied, No. No. No. I dont want to do that at all.  I just want whats right.

EPA, you cant get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay?  he said. Thats why people dont want to invest in this country.

It is unclear which permit application Trump was referring to, but he has repeatedly criticized EPA rules. And though he has given mixed signals on whether he would back out of the United States voluntary commitments under the Paris climate agreement, it would take several years for the next administration to withdraw now that the agreement has entered into force.


Last week Trumps transition team for the Energy Department asked officials there to identify which employees have participated in international climate negotiations or worked on domestic efforts to cut greenhouse gases, such as calculating the social cost of carbon. Several scientists, federal union officials and public watchdog groups have expressed concern that these individuals could be targeted for retaliation once Trump takes office.

Trump sons distance themselves from fundraiser,"After reports that Donald Trumps adult sons were listed as directors for a nonprofit offering inauguration weekend access to the president-elect, the Trump campaign pushed back on claims of their involvement in the organization. 

The Center for Public Integrity reviewed filing documents for the Opening Day Foundation, a Texas nonprofit formed on Dec. 14 that says its dedicated to preserving the great outdoors. In a draft invitiation to the event, billed as Opening Day 2017, donors giving at least $500,000 to the nonprofit were promised a private reception and photo opportunity with Mr. Trump as well as a multi-day hunting and/or fishing excursion with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.

Opening Day is your opportunity to play a significant role as our family commemorates the inauguration of our father, friend and President Donald J. Trump. Join us as we celebrate the great American tradition of outdoor sporting, shooting, fishing and conservation, reads a draft of the invitation, first obtained by TMZ. The draft invitation also listed Mr. Trumps two adult sons as honorary co-chairmen of the event.

But Tuesday afternoon, Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks denied the involvement of Mr. Trumps sons. 

The Opening Day event and details that have been reported are merely initial concepts that have not been approved or pursued by the Trump family, said Hicks in a statement. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are avid outdoorsmen and supporters of conservation efforts, which align with the goals of this event, however they are not involved in any capacity. 

In a call with reporters Wednesday, the transition team repeated that the Trump sons would have no involvement with the event itself. 

According to the New York Times, the event is still scheduled, but references to the hunting trip have been removed. 

The Camouflage & Cufflinks-themed evening will still be held at a convention center in Washington, D.C. on January 21, the day following Mr. Trumps inauguration to the White House.

But soon after the Center for Public Integrity found that the Opening Day Foundations nonprofit registration papers also listed Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump as directors of the organization, a spokeswoman for the president-elect released a statement disavowing the participation of the Trumps.

Poll: Majority of Americans Pessimistic or Uncertain About Trump Presidency,"As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to be sworn in as the country's commander-in-chief next month, a majority of Americans say they are either uncertain or pessimistic about his presidency, even as the country is sounding a more optimistic tone about the future of the economy and Trump's ability to bring positive change to Washington D.C.

A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds 54 percent of adults saying that they are either uncertain (25 percent) or pessimistic and worried (29 percent) about how Trump will perform during his presidency, compared with 45 percent with either an optimistic and confident view (22 percent) or a satisfied and hopeful view (23 percent).

That's a significantly worse outlook than Americans expressed after the elections of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. A combined 66 percent were either optimistic or hopeful about Obama in January 2009, according to the same poll, while 59 percent were optimistic or hopeful about George W. Bush in January 2001.


The data show the extent to which the nation remains unusually divided even though Election Day is in the rearview mirror, said Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, which conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm Public Opinion Strategies.

""Usually elections settle arguments and the nation comes together, at least in the short term,"" Yang said. ""Today, hard feelings persist on both sides of the partisan divide. It's as if the 2016 campaign has never ended.""

Those partisan differences are particularly stark when it comes to public approval ratings of the way Trump is handling his transition. Half of the country overall gives Trump high marks so far, compared to 41 percent who give him a thumbs down. But among Hillary Clinton's voters, only 12 percent approve of how he's handling the transition, compared to 92 percent of Trump voters.

Back in 2008, 50 percent of John McCain's voters approved of Barack Obama's handling of his presidential transition, and in 1992, 63 percent of George H.W. Bush's voters backed Bill Clinton's early moves as president-elect.


The partisan divide extends to views about the men and women Trump has selected to lead his administration. Seventy-eight percent of Democrats say they are disappointed with the administration appointments Trump has made so far, while 80 percent of Republicans say they are generally pleased with Trump's picks.

While Trump's overall favorability has ticked up modestly since before the election, he remains underwater, with more Americans giving him a poor rating (46 percent) than a positive one (40 percent.)

That marks the first time that an incoming president has been viewed more negatively than positively in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll.

Some bright spots -- but ones mostly driven by enthusiasm from Trump's supporters

While the public is largely apprehensive about the president-elect, Americans do say that they are more optimistic that the U.S. economy will improve in the next year. Forty-two percent say they believe the economy will get better - the highest share since autumn of 2012 -- while only 19 percent say the economy will get worse in the next year.

Trump has also generated relatively positive feelings about his ability to change the federal government for the better. A majority of Americans say Trump will shake up the way government operates - and, among that group, they believe that he'll bring the right kind of change by a two-to-one margin (41 percent to 20 percent).

Additionally, a majority - fifty-six percent - say they are optimistic that Trump will keep U.S. jobs from going overseas.


Still, the confidence about Trump's presidency is mostly fueled by enthusiasm among his base voters rather than by more hopeful expectations among those who didn't choose him on their ballot in November.

A whopping 92 percent of Trump voters are optimistic about his ability to bring change to Washington, while just 20 percent of Clinton voters say the same. The same share of Trump voters - 92 percent - say they are hopeful that Trump will look out for those who are struggling in today's economy, while only nine percent of Clinton voters agree.


Those who say that the economy will get better in the next year rather than worse include key Trump constituency groups like whites (49 percent better compared to 15 percent worse), Republicans (68 percent better to six percent worse), and men (46 percent better to 15 percent worse.) Among Democrats, 33 percent believe the economy will get worse compared to 19 percent who believe it will improve, and just 22 percent of African Americans think the economy will improve compared to a third who say it will deteriorate.

The public also still harbors concerns about Trump's temperament. Just 36 percent of Americans say they are optimistic that Trump has the right temperament to be president, while 44 percent say they are worried about the issue.

The Republican Party gets a boost - but will it last?

In the wake of the 2016 election, the Republican Party now has a higher net favorability rating (35 percent positive, 38 percent negative) than the Democratic Party (34 percent positive, 42 percent negative). That's the first time since after the 2010 midterms that Republicans have scored better on the favorability measure than their Democratic counterparts.

But it's not clear that Americans' warmer feelings toward the GOP will endure. After its previous high watermark six years ago, the party's positive ratings quickly fell back to earth, with Democrats regaining the advantage the following month.",R
"Key Union Backs Tom Perez for DNC Chair, Breaking With AFL-CIO","The International Association of Firefighters, the main union representing American firefighters, has placed itself on a collision course with the AFL-CIO in the race for the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, deciding to back Labor Secretary Tom Perez over Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison.

The Democratic leadership contest has taken on unusual significance in the wake of Hillary Clinton's devastating loss last month, dividing the labor movement between two Democrats whom it has long seen as allies.

The AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 unions that includes the IAFF, endorsed Ellison just before Perez entered the race last week, despite protests from IAFF President Harold Schaitberger and others.

In a statement, Schaitberger praised Perez as a ""a tireless advocate for civil and human rights"" who can transcend what the union president called ""a narrow focus on identity and cultural politics that alienated"" some longtime Democrats from the party.

""Tom Perez is the person who has the right mix of personal background, progressive values, experience and total commitment to all workers, in all regions and states across the country,"" Schaitberger said. ""To have Tom Perez as the Chair of one of our nation's two major political parties would be a significant victory for workers across America.""

Perez, the son of Dominican immigrants, has been leaning on his heritage to appeal to Latino DNC members. But Schaitberger, whose union is on the conservative end of the spectrum, said the Labor Secretary is the best person to reorient the party around ""a strong economic message that is truly inclusive of everyone.""

Ellison, an African-American convert to Islam who supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary, has faced questions over past associations with Nation of Islam founder Louis Farrakhan, whom he long ago disowned.

Schaitberger earlier spoke out against the AFL-CIO's endorsement process, which gave its executive committee members only three options: Vote to endorse Ellison, abstain, or make no endorsement.

That vote was an attempt to present a united front from the labor movement, which is well represented among the voting members of the DNC, and to avoid a damaging intraparty squabble.

But the IAFF is the second major union in the AFL-CIO to back Perez, and more defections may come.

On Friday, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union  one of the country's largest unions, with 1.3 million members  came out in support of the labor secretary, saying its members ""saw firsthand his passion and commitment"" to their issues during his work heading the Department of Labor.

Another union, the United Farm Workers, endorsed Perez on Monday. Their membership is small, but the endorsement comes with a symbolic connection to famed labor leader Cesar Chavez, who founded the union.

""He has been a lifelong friend of labor and immigrants. When farm workers needed him, Tom Perez stood up and fought,"" said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez, noting it was the first time the union has ever endorsed in a DNC chair race. ""He played a key role in helping farm workers in California win the same overtime pay protections as all other workers, and in doing so is helping end 78 years of race-based discrimination.""

However, Ellison has the backing of a number of powerful individual unions in addition to the AFL-CIO, including two of the very biggest: The American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Their support was a coup for Ellison not only because of their size, but because both were active Clinton allies, an important point as Ellison works to expand his support beyond his base among Sanders supporters.

The election for DNC chair will be held in February during a party meeting in Atlanta, but will feature a series of regional forums where candidates will discuss their platforms before then.",R
Brexit Uncertainties Threaten Brain Drain for UK Science,"Like many foreign scientists in Britain, Joanna Bagniewska was devastated when Britons voted to leave the European Union. The biology lecturer, a Polish migrant who found Britain a welcoming place to build her academic career over a decade, is suddenly seeing her job security and research prospects up in the air.

""I'm worried that after my current contract finishes, one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card,"" she said. ""I'd like to apply for EU grant money, but how much longer will it be available for?""

Britain's top universities have long been among the world's most sought-after destinations for study and research, drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe. But since Britons voted in June to leave the 28-nation EU, many in the science community say the U.K. risks losing the money, the international influence  and crucially, the talent  to sustain that enviable position.

More than one-tenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years. Some fields  such as nanotechnology and cancer research  are more dependent on EU funding than others, according to a report by technology firm Digital Science. From 2007 to 2013, Britain received 8.8 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in direct EU investment in research.

Bagniewska is not just anxious about herself  she's upset for her students' future too, for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for granted.

""They were just getting excited about doing their masters and Ph.Ds in other countries. And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled,"" she said.

Scientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries. The bloc's freedom of movement means its 500 million people can live and work visa-free in any member state.

No one knows yet what form Britain's exit from the EU  commonly known as Brexit  is going to take, but immigration was a key issue for ""Leave"" voters. Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to Britain.

Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders. She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain, an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the 32,000 Europeans who make up 16 percent of the academic workforce in British universities. Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afield.

Scientists for EU, an advocacy group, says it has received over 400 letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work. Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers. Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold. One said their employer, a London university, immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze, citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research income.

Adam Durrant, a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers, says he's now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain. Part of the reason, he says, is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than before.

""In the future, it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the U.K. to work,"" said Durrant. ""There's a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future. I will certainly retain a U.K. presence, but my company's focus of gravity may shift elsewhere.""

Scientists say some U.K.-based researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleagues.

Paul Crowther, head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield, said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum. The vote ""put the U.K.-based researchers in a very awkward position"" and their participation in EU-funded programs could ""compromise the project,"" he was told.

""The erosion of U.K. involvement in EU networks has already begun, with both the U.K. and EU science worse off,"" Crowther said.

Apart from a loss of grant money, Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructure.

""Large-scale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases, the building of large facilities, are areas that multinational collaborations do much better,"" said Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist and president of Britain's prestigious Royal Society.

The EU is an important source of research funding for Britain, which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science. In 2014, Britain's government spent under 0.5 percent of its GDP on research  below the European average, and half that of South Korea.

May's government is clearly aware of the jitters. She has promised to increase annual investment in research by 2 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by 2020, in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovation.

Durrant is doubtful that's enough to make a big difference.

""Two billion a year spread across everything isn't going to go very far,"" he said.

Similar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level. The 125,000 European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans. Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year  but no one knows what will happen after that.

Fewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britain's most competitive university courses, including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge. In September, the admission service UCAS reported a 9 percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in 2017.

Some argue that Britain could become like Switzerland, an ""associate"" EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projects.

""It's not all doom and gloom  but it will be harder,"" Ramakrishnan said. ""We could make a go of it outside the EU. But for that to happen, we have to attract talent and fund science. And those two things are critical.""",R
"Donald Trump accuses President Obama of ""roadblocks"" during transition","President-elect Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric against President Obama on Wednesday, accusing the current president of roadblocks leading up to Inauguration Day.

In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said he was doing [his] best to disregard the inflammatory  statements and roadblocks from Mr. Obama:

Mr. Trump was presumably still responding to Mr. Obamas comments in a podcast interview released Monday, in which he said he would have been able to mobilize Americans against Mr. Trump had he been able to run for a third term in 2016.

I am confident in this vision because Im confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I couldve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it, Mr. Obama said in the interview with David Axelrod, his former senior political advisor, which was released on Axelrods podcast AxeFiles. I know that in conversations that Ive had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one.

These comments appear to have gotten under Mr. Trumps skin: Wednesdays tweet is the third in three days about Mr. Obama.

On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that there is NO WAY Mr. Obama could have defeated him if he had been able to run for a third term this year:

And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said Mr. Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost:

Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama seemed to move past the scathing campaign trail rhetoric in the weeks immediately following Election Day, talking by phone on several occasions and speaking in positive terms about their interactions.

In a meeting with The New York Times in November, Mr. Trump described his great meeting with Mr. Obama. I didnt know if Id like him, Mr. Trump said. I probably thought that maybe I wouldnt, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot.

But as Inauguration Day approaches, it appears that goodwill is not going to last. Mr. Trump has been critical of several of Mr. Obamas recent decisions, including the abstention on the United Nations Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements.

Mr. Obama, too, has offered veiled criticisms of Mr. Trump in recent public speeches and appearances. For example, speaking aside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that even when hatred burns hottest, even when the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward. We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.",R
Donald Trump taps former Bush aide as top counterterrorism adviser,"President-elect Donald Trump has tapped former Bush aide Tom Bossert to serve as assistant to the President for homeland security and counterterrorism, his transition team announced Tuesday.

Tom brings enormous depth and breadth of knowledge and experience to protecting the homeland to our senior White House team, Mr. Trump said in a statement. He has a handle on the complexity of homeland security, counterterrorism, and cybersecurity challenges. He will be an invaluable asset to our Administration.

The post will be a return to the White House for Bossert, who previously served as the deputy homeland security advisor to former President George W. Bush. Before that, he spent two years as the White Houses director of infrastructure protection policy.

Since leaving the White House, Bossert has run a national security consulting business and served as a fellow at the Atlantic Council focusing on cybersecurity.

Mr. Trumps transition team said the position for which Bossert was selected has recently been performed by a deputy to the National Security Advisor, but that in Mr. Trumps administration the job is being elevated and restored to its independent status. 

Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.) will serve as Mr. Trumps National Security Advisor.

I am looking forward to working closely with Gen. Flynn as we together help the President-elect advance the interests of the United States and its allies, Bossert said in a statement.",R
Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back,"Updated Dec. 25 at 3:53 pm E.T.

President-elect Donald Trump plans to dissolve his foundation, his transition team announced on in statement on Saturday.

Soon after, though, the New York attorney general's spokesperson tweeted that he legally can't, until the state's investigation of the Trump Foundation is complete.

.@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Foundation still under investigation by @AGSchneiderman, cannot legally dissolve until investigation complete
 Amy Spitalnick (@amyspitalnick) December 24, 2016
Press Secretary Amy Spitalnick was responding to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold, who asked if the investigation would continue.

In October, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York, saying the charity was not registered to do so under state law.

In Saturday's statement, Trump is quoted as saying:

""The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children. However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.""
The announcement comes shortly after a report from The New York Times discussing the president-elect's many potential conflicts of interest. The Times reports that Trump and his family ""are rushing to resolve potential controversies  like shuttering foundations and terminating development deals  even as the president-elect publicly maintains that no legal conflicts exist.""

An NPR report from earlier this year compared the work of the Trump Foundation with that of the Clinton Foundation, which came under fire during the campaign, noting the similarities seem to end with their names. As NPR's Joel Rose reported, ""The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, as it's formally known, is huge. It has hundreds of employees and a $90 million budget. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, by contrast, is fairly small. It has no full-time employees and a budget of about $600,000.""

In an interview with NPR's Allison Aubrey Sunday, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold provided context.

""The Donald J. Trump Foundation has been around since the late '80s, and on paper it sort of looks like what a lot of other rich people have, which is a foundation that's set up to give Trump's money away. But it's actually not that at all  for many of the recent years between 2009 and 2015, it didn't actually get any money from Trump at all  instead he gave away other people's money kind of under his own name, to people that thought they were getting Trump's money. He also used it to apparently violate the law in a number of ways  he used it to buy big portraits of himself including one that hangs on the wall of a sports bar he owns, and he used it to pay off debts or obligations that his businesses have incurred. So he was already under investigation by the New York Attorney General for apparently violating a number of federal laws that govern charities.""
David Fahrenthold's reporting in the Post has shown that Trump hasn't given any of his own money to the foundation since 2008. The Post says Vince and Linda McMahon, owners of World Wrestling Entertainment, have been major donors; Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration.",R
"Trump has no idea how to run a superpower, say Chinese media","Donald Trump appears to have not a clue how to lead a superpower.

That was the conclusion of Chinas Global Times newspaper on Monday morning as the countrys media weighed in on the president-elects latest social media assaults on Beijing.


Don't let China ties slide into 'full conflict mode', Obama urges Trump
 Read more
Trump is not behaving as a president who will become master of the White House in a month, the Communist party controlled newspaper wrote in an editorial. He bears no sense of how to lead a superpower.

The article came after the US president-elect again used Twitter, which has been blocked in China since 2009, to berate the leaders of the worlds second largest economy.

China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters  rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented [sic] act, Trump tweeted early on Saturday morning after it emerged the Chinese navy had seized a US naval drone that had been operating in the South China Sea.

In a second tweet, Trump wrote:

Those 221 characters threatened to further alienate Chinas rulers, already reeling from Trumps recent decision to hold a 10-minute phone call with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, and threat to upend long-standing US policy on Taiwan.

On Friday, President Obama cautioned Trump against allowing relations with China slip into full conflict mode.

In its editorial, the fervently nationalist Global Times, a state-run tabloid that sometimes reflects official thinking, indicated such a deterioration was certainly on the cards if Trump continued to act up.

People in China were unsure whether the billionaires attacks on Beijing were part of attempts to wage a psychological war or simply an example of his amateurishness.

But if he treats China after assuming office in the same way as in his tweets, China will not exercise restraint, the newspaper warned. The Chinese government should be fully prepared for a hardline Trump.

In an online video that has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, the newspapers controversial editor, Hu Xijin, said: I dont know if he is playing the psychological card with China or is in fact just unprofessional  China should teach him some lessons so he might learn to respect China after he is sworn in.

A comment piece on the front page of the overseas edition of the Communist partys official mouthpiece, the Peoples Daily, also suggested Beijing would not be cowed by Trumps provocations.

It is difficult to understand his true psychology, wrote Hua Yiwen, whom the paper described as an international affairs expert. But China shouldnt spend much effort trying to guess what he is thinking. We should simply stand firm, take control of the situation and handle it calmly.

Bill Bishop, a Washington DC-based China expert, said he sensed abject despair in the US capital at how Trump was conducting US-China relations through misspelled tweets.

This is unpresidented behaviour by a precedent-elect, joked Bishop. It would be funny if the stakes werent so high.


China should plan to take Taiwan by force after Trump call, state media says

This is not a business deal. This is a political relationship between nuclear powers who are already on the path towards conflict in several dimensions, added Bishop, who publishes the influential Sinocism newsletter.

This kind of uncertainty, this kind of petulance, this kind of random tweeting  is not a grand strategy that is going to push the Chinese on to their heels so they are going to make concessions. This is juvenile, immature, inexperienced behaviour that has the potential to lead to many problems in the US-China relationship, some of which could have some pretty serious and damaging ramifications.

Bishop questioned the Chinese medias suggestion that Trumps tweets were part of a wily psychological ploy to force trade concessions from Beijing. I wouldnt ascribe brilliant psychological warfare skills to Donald Trump, he said.

Was it possible Trumps tweets were part of an ingenious new master plan for Sino-US relations that would emerge after his inauguration on 20 January? Bishop was skeptical.

I think that is about as likely as Xi Jinping waking up on 1 December, 2017 and declaring China a democracy.",R
"Obama Designates Atlantic, Arctic Areas Off-Limits To Offshore Drilling","President Obama has indefinitely blocked offshore drilling in areas of the Atlantic Ocean and in Arctic waters, a move aimed at advancing environmental protection during his final days in office.

The Arctic protections are a joint partnership with Canada. ""These actions, and Canada's parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth,"" the White House said in a statement.

""They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region's harsh conditions is limited,"" the White House added. ""By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region  at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.""


This map shows the Atlantic areas that have been designated off limits to oil and gas explorations and development activity.
White House
Obama's action designates 31 Atlantic canyons ""off limits to oil and gas exploration and development activity,"" totaling 3.8 million acres, according to the administration. It provides the same protections to much of the Arctic's waters, covering the ""vast majority of U.S. waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas,"" totaling 115 million acres. Canada is doing the same to ""all Arctic Canadian waters,"" the joint statement adds.

Obama took these actions by invoking a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which gives the president the authority to withdraw lands from oil and gas leases. But as NPR's Jeff Brady and Jennifer Ludden report, major questions remain about what will happen if the incoming Trump administration attempts to reverse this action.

""The White House says the president is acting within his authority, that Presidents of both parties have done this in the past, and trying to reverse such an order would be unprecedented if Trump tried to do this,"" Jeff said on All Things Considered.

There is no legal precedent for reversal, Jeff reports. ""So if there's a legal challenge, and I'm not going to be surprised if there is one, it's really not clear what a court would decide.""


This map shows the area that the U.S. has designated as indefinitely off limits to offshore oil and gas leasing.
White House
As Bloomberg reports, the ""statute doesn't include a provision for reversal and that action may take years to work its way through court.""

Environmental groups such as Oceana are celebrating the designation. ""President Obama has taken a key step in protecting important areas of the Atlantic Ocean from offshore drilling,"" as Jacqueline Savitz, the group's senior vice president for the United States, said in a statement. ""The people of the Atlantic coast refused to allow their way of life to be compromised and we commend their hard work making their voices heard in Washington.""

Representatives of the oil and gas industry are unhappy about the news. ""We think it's a very short-sighted decision to take these areas off limits,"" Andy Radford, senior policy advisor for offshore issues at the American Petroleum Institute, told Jeff the action poses ""great risk to our energy security going forward and eliminates the opportunity to create jobs and help small businesses throughout the country. ""

Earlier this year, the Obama administration reversed course on a plan that would have allowed Atlantic offshore drilling after uproar from local communities and environmentalists.

Then, the administration designated the first national marine monument in the Atlantic Ocean. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that it has protected an Atlantic area about the size of New Jersey from deep-sea commercial fishing.",R
"Clinton FBI Director Backs Trump's Attorney General Pick Jeff Sessions, Defends His Records on Civil Rights","The campaign to rally support for Donald Trumps pick to head the Justice Department is growing, with former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who served under President Bill Clinton, now joining the effort.

In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Freeh offered his strong recommendation that Senators confirm their colleague Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as the next attorney general, defending his record on civil rights, which has become a key concern for critics.

I have known Jeff since 1989 when we worked together as prosecutors on one of the most important civil rights cases investigated and prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice, Freeh wrote. [I] have always been greatly impressed with his commitment to the rule of law, his fair and balanced prosecutorial judgment, and his personal dedication to protecting civil rights.

What Jeff Sessions Has Said About Race and Civil Rights
After Sessions was announced as Trumps pick for attorney general, top Democrats and some civil rights groups expressed concern over decades-old allegations that he made racist remarks when he was U.S. Attorney in Alabama. Others alleged -- under oath during his 1986 confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship -- that he once called a white civil rights lawyer a disgrace to his race and dubbed some efforts by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ""un-American.""

During the hearings, one lawyer who worked with Sessions claimed the lawmaker told him he thought the KKK was ""OK until I found out they smoked pot."" Sessions said the comment was a joke but apologized.

Under oath himself, Sessions also insisted he harbored no racial bias and said the allegations were either false or being taken out of context. He was nevertheless blocked from becoming a judge.

In his letter on Tuesday, Freeh pointed to Sessions work on the 1989 murders of a federal judge in Alabama and an NAACP official in Georgia.

I was struck with Jeffs fierce determination to solve these civil rights murders, which so gravely impacted the rule of law and the guarantee of civil rights in America, Freeh wrote, noting that, Jeff and his office were key decision-makers in formulating and implementing the investigative strategy which ultimately led to the arrest and conviction of Walter Moody for these murders.

Meanwhile, a conservative judicial organization, the Judicial Crisis Network, has created an entire website devoted to pushing Sessions' confirmation.

He is a world-class legal mind and a tough but fair lawyer with invaluable experience, says the website, ConfirmSessions.com. Known for his deep respect for the Constitution and adherence to the rule of law, Sen. Sessions has worked tirelessly to defend the civil rights and legal rights of all Americans.

Democratic Party leaders, meanwhile, have called Sessions nomination deeply troubling.

Over the course of his career, Senator Sessions used the power of the courts to discriminate against civil rights leaders, allegedly used racially charged language to disparage minorities, expressed support for the KKK and then tried to dismiss it as a joke, celebrated the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, opposed same-sex marriage, denied the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade, voted against greater access to healthcare for veterans, blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, and voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act,"" Democratic National Committee Interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement last month.

Freeh, who served as FBI director from 1993 to June 2001, expressed no such concerns, calling Sessions a friend who has had a distinguished career in public service.

I believe that Jeff will be an outstanding Attorney General for the Nation, Freeh said.",R
Rand Paul Gives Glimpse of Trouble Trump May Face With His Party Over Government Spending,"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave an indication today of the trouble that President-elect Trump may face from his own party in trying to fulfill campaign promises that cost money.

The former GOP presidential candidate said on ABC News' ""This Week"" that he ""won't vote for a budget that never balances"" and that he is working to find a few other conservative GOP senators to join him.

""The current budget that the Republicans are looking at never balances. How can that be fiscally responsible? And how can we look at the public with a straight face and say, yes, we ran on balanced budgets, we're for the balanced budget amendment, and yet the budget we're going to introduce, that we're going to repeal Obamacare with never balances?"" Paul said.

Trump this week repeated his promise that he wants a trillion-dollar infrastructure program and he promised during the campaign to repeal Obamacare.

Paul said that with the help of other conservative senators he might be able to block a budget that he considers irresponsible.

""All it takes is a couple of us. If there are a few conservatives in the Senate wing of the Republican Party that will say no to a budget that never balances, we could have the power to say to the leadership, you know what, we need a better budget,"" Paul said.

""I don't know if it will happen, but I know that I will be one that won't vote for a budget that never balances,"" he said.

Paul also addressed reports that ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson has emerged as a likely pick for secretary of state, saying that he is ""going to reserve judgment on Tillerson.""

But the Kentucky senator had strong warnings about former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who is a possible contender for secretary of state or deputy secretary of state.

""I'll do anything to try to prevent John Bolton from getting any position because I think his world view is naive,"" Paul said. ""He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War. He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran. He wants to do regime change in Iran.""

""John Bolton doesn't get it,"" Paul said.",R
"Trump is within his rights to use executive power, Obama says","WASHINGTON  President Obama says he has no regrets about his go-it-alone use of executive power  even if President-elect Donald Trump can now use those same powers to roll back his policies.

""I think that he is entirely within his lawful power to do so,"" Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio broadcast Monday. ""If he wants to reverse some of those rules, that's part of the democratic process.""

In his traditional end-of-year public radio interview, Obama offered a wide-ranging defense of his use of presidential power as he prepares to turn the levers of that power over to man he once described as unfit for the presidency.

Obama argued that his use of executive action wasn't much different from his predecessors. What changed, he said, is that Congress became less willing to pass legislation.

""Congress has become so dysfunctional that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they're not constantly refreshed and tweaked,"" he said. ""And the bottom line is, if you want to right-size executive power relative to the other branches of government, the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating, disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislation.""

The same thing has happened on foreign policy, he said. The Obama administration has been relying a post-9/11 congressional war authorization intended for al-Qaeda in order to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

""The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in,"" he said. ""The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate.""

But Obama also said he's installed ""guardrails"" on the president's war powers, setting up systems of internal accountability on issues like drone strikes and electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency.

""You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we haven't gone far enough on that. I would argue that we've gotten it about right, although I'm the first one to admit that we didn't get it all right on day one,"" he said.",R
"Israel claims ""ironclad"" proof that the Obama administration was behind U.N. rebuke","JERUSALEM - Doubling down on its public break with the Obama administration, a furious Israeli government on Tuesday said it had received ironclad information from Arab sources that Washington actively helped craft last weeks U.N. resolution declaring Israeli settlements illegal.

The allegations further poisoned the increasingly toxic atmosphere between Israel and the outgoing Obama administration in the wake of Fridays vote, and raised questions about whether the White House might take further action against Israeli settlements in its final weeks in office.

With the U.S. expected to participate in an international peace conference in France next month and Secretary of State John Kerry planning a final policy speech, the Palestinians said they were hoping to capitalize on the momentum from the Security Council vote.

The U.N. vote's impact on U.S.-Israel relations
Although the U.S. has long opposed Israeli settlements on occupied lands, it has traditionally used its veto in the U.N. Security Council to protect its ally Israel from international censure. But in a change of policy, it abstained from Fridays vote, allowing the resolution to pass by a 14-0 margin.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long had a cool relationship with President Barack Obama, has called the resolution shameful and accused the U.S. of playing a leading role in its passage.

On Tuesday, his spokesman went even further.

We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage, David Keyes said.

Were not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night as the Obama administration helps push such a grave resolution, he said.

How U.N. resolution against Israel will impact U.S. relations
He did not identify the Arab sources or say how Israel obtained the information. Israel has close security ties with Egypt, an original sponsor of last weeks resolution. Under heavy Israeli pressure, Egypt delayed the resolution last week before other council members presented it for a vote a day later. Egypt ended up voting in favor of the measure.

Keyes claim mirrors that of his boss Netanyahu, who told his Cabinet on Sunday: From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama Administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed.

Netanyahu insists that there is nothing wrong with his controversial policy of building Jewish towns in occupied areas that the Palestinians, with overwhelming world support, claim for their state.   

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power defended the U.S. abstention, saying, We would not have let this resolution pass if it hadnt addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians. And she added that the vote does not in any way diminish the United States steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel.  

Power also warned that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state, which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace, CBS News Margaret Brennan reports. 

The United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades, Power said.

Israels recent diplomatic defeat would be much more damaging if not for a potential remaining and rather major ace in Netanyahus hand: the incoming Trump Administration. 

In a striking departure from past policy of incumbent presidents waiting on the sidelines, Trump tried to scuttle the resolution and called for a U.S. veto. After the vote, Trump vowed that things will be different after Jan. 20th. 

Critically, he has appointed an outspoken supporter and donor to the settlements, his longtime attorney David Friedman, as ambassador to Israel. And aides say Trump is serious about a promise to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which even many Israelis fear could spark violence. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, home to sensitive religious sites, as the capital of the future state to which they aspire. 

After Fridays vote, Netanyahus office said he looked forward to working with Trump to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.   

It remains unclear what Trump might be able to do. While he will be able to wield the U.S. veto to prevent further action against Israel in the council, mustering enough votes to overturn Fridays decision appears to be impossible. 

The basis for the resolution is found in the Geneva conventions, which forbid the settling of areas captured in war from another country. Israel has said the law doesnt apply because the territory was captured from Jordan, which has renounced all claims to the land. Israel has also defended the occupation on religious and security grounds. 

When Netanyahus rivals in Israel oppose the settlements, it is not necessarily due to a conviction that could be peace could be at hand, but rather for concern for Israels democracy. If Israel becomes inseparable from the West Bank, it will have to grant its 2.5 million Palestinians voting rights, or increasingly be unable to call itself a democracy. 

The country is toxically divided on the issue, and key sectors of society, including intellectual elites and much of its security establishment, want to see settlements end. Many of them welcome - some openly, and many more quietly - any world pressure to bring that about. 

Dan Miodownik, a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University, said there were actually some positive elements for Israel in the resolution. 

He said it endorsed the idea of territorial swaps, meaning that Israel could keep some settlements as part of a negotiated peace deal. And the differentiation between Israel proper and the settlements signaled that unlike in the past, Israel was no longer being forced to defend its right to exist.  ",R
Report: Trump team questions costs of State Department's environment efforts,"Donald Trumps transition team is asking State Department officials to reveal how much of their funding goes towards international environmental groups, according to a new Washington Post report. 

The query, posed in a list of questions to the State Departments Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, asked, How much does the Department of State contribute annually to international environmental organizations in which the department participates?

State Department spokesperson John Kirby noted Wednesday, however, that there is nothing out of hte norm regarding questions being asked by the transition team. 

The questions, Kirby told reporters, were very much aligned with their need to better understand the bureaucracy and organization that theyre about to lead. 

Nothing falls outside the normal inquiries, Kirby said. 

Despite State Department assurances, the inquiry has increased worries that the president-elects transition team is prioritizing a rollback of the Obama administrations actions on climate change and conservation efforts. 

While Mr. Trump has met with prominent climate change activists since his election victory, the president-elect has also tapped several people to lead government agencies that have agendas contrary to Mr. Obamas own climate and renewable fuel focus. For instance, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt -- who Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency -- is a vocal denier of climate change science and has even sued the Obama administration over its clean power plant rules. Mr. Trumps pick for secretary of state, oil magnate Rex Tillerson, has said climate change could pose significant risks, but there is little indication that the Exxon Mobil executive will prioritze the issue. 

Mr. Trump also threatened during his campaign to scuttle the United States involvement in the landmark Paris climate change accord, an international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions and try to reverse global warming effects. The Paris treaty holds the U.S. accountable for donating $3 billion over four years to the Green Climate Fund, which is devoted to helping poorer countries weather the detrimental effects of climate change.

Similarly, the Energy Department was also recently sent a questionnaire to divulge the names of employees who had worked on climate change policies. The department said it would not be complying with that request, and the Trump transition team disavowed the original questionnaire, saying it was not authorized.

The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment confirming the Post report.

According to the White Houses Office of Management and Budget, of the State Departments 2016 budget of $30.91 billion, about $128 million was allocated for natural resources and the environment.  ",R
Report: White House preparing response to Russian election interference,"The Obama administration is preparing to announce a response, which may include cyber-operations, to the alleged Russian interference in last months election, according to a Washington Post report citing anonymous U.S. officials.

The report says that details are still being finalized but are likely to include new economic sanctions.

President Obama has said that his administration would respond to Russian meddling in the U.S. election. 

I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, that we need to take action and we will -- at a time and a place of our own choosing, Mr. Obama told NPRs Steve Inskeep earlier this month. Some of it may be ... explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be.

Intelligence officials believed Russia was involved in the hacking of Democratic servers last summer. Russia dismisses the charges.

Ian Bremmer on impact of Russia hack, China drone controversy
A 2015 executive order, as intended, gives the president the authority to respond to foreign cyberattacks. However, officials concluded that the order did not give the president authority to respond to Russian meddling in American elections, prompting a last-ditch effort within the administration to expand the presidents authority on the matter.

According to the Post, officials are also trying to figure out ways to make it difficult for president-elect Trump, who has frequently spoken of improving relations with Russia, from diminishing any response from the Obama administration.

Part of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back, the Post quotes a senior administration official as saying.

The announcement of the response could come as early as this week, the paper states. Officials quoted in the story say they hope to create a deterrent against future election meddling by other nations.

As much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future, the Post quotes an administration official as saying.

I am firmly convinced that the Russians and others will say, That worked pretty well in 2016, so lets keep going. We have elections every two years in this country.",R

Despite Mr. Trumps assertion that he has given millions of dollars to the Trump Foundation, news reports have indicated that Mr. Trump vastly oversells his charitable giving. And since he has not released his tax returns, its impossible to verify how much money he has given to charity. 

According to the Washington Post, Mr. Trump has given only one traceable personal donation since 2008 -- for $10,000, to the Police Athletic League of New York City. As for the Trump Foundation, Mr. Trump has given $5.5 million to the group since its inception -- but has not contributed to it since 2008, meaning the organization has largely been funded by other people in recent years.

In addition, several reports have established that Mr. Trump used money from the foundation to help further his political interests. The Washington Post reported, for example, that Mr. Trump used foundation funds to settle legal disputes -- and even to buy two large portraits of himself, one of which hung on the wall of a Trump-owned golf resort. He paid a $2,500 fine to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) earlier this year after it was revealed that his foundation made a $25,000 political contribution that violated tax laws.

The series of tweets came just two days after Mr. Trump announced he would be shuttering the foundation in the wake of questions about possible conflicts of interest.

Mr. Trump said in a Christmas Eve statement that he has directed his counsel to begin taking steps toward dissolving the foundation; however, it cannot formally shut down until the New York state attorney generals office completes its investigation of the foundation.

To avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways, Mr. Trump said in his statement.

Mr. Trumps tweets about the Trump Foundation also came just hours after he insisted on Twitter that there was no way President Obama could have beaten him in a hypothetical 2016 election between the two men, and criticized the United Nations for not living up to its great potential.",R
Michelle Obama: Presidential Election Was 'Challenging' to Watch,"Michelle Obama in a candid interview with Oprah Winfrey opened up for the first time publicly about the 2016 presidential campaign, calling it ""challenging"" for her ""as a citizen to watch and experience.""

The first lady said it was important ""for the health of this nation"" that she and her husband, President Barack Obama, support President-elect Donald Trump, even though she said some political leaders didn't support her husband's presidency.

""So we're going to be there for the next president and do whatever we have to do to make sure that he is successful, because if he succeeds, we all succeed,"" Obama told Winfrey during her final one-on-one White House interview, which aired Monday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.

In the one-hour program, Obama reflected on her eight years as first lady, discussing topics including her surprise at being called an ""angry black woman"" during her husband's 2007 presidential campaign and Trump's comments about women.

""For all the people out there, they have to understand that, as I've said time and time again, words matter,"" she said. ""And they matter most to our kids, our young people. And the words that we say moving forward, all of us, it matters, which is one of the reasons why Barack and I are so supportive of this transition.""

Obama also put to rest speculation she would run for president, citing the strain it would place on her family.

""Sixteen years, I wouldn't do that to my kids because what people don't understand is that you run, their lives stop, at any age,"" she said. ""The next family that comes in here, every person in that family, every child, every grandchild, their lives will be turned upside down in a way that no American really understands.""

Winfrey also asked about Trump's post-election visit to the White House.

""It was very pleasant,"" she said. ""It was a wonderful visit because this is a really great job.""

Obama said she and Melania Trump talked about the kids and said she told the incoming first lady that her ""door is open"" for any questions.

""My offer to Melania was you really don't know what you don't know until you're here, so the door is open as I've told her,"" Obama said, adding that she's modeling what the Bushes had done for her.

Obama also took time to reflect on her accomplishments, saying she thinks she moved the needle on childhood obesity and changed the conversation on how Americans look at the military.

President Barack Obama also made an appearance during the interview, discussing what surprised him about how his wife filled the role of first lady.

""We all knew she was brilliant and cute and strong and a great mom,"" the president said. ""But I think the way in which she blended purpose and policy with fun, so that she was able to reach beyond Washington on her healthcare initiatives, on her military family work, was masterful.""

Michelle Obama said she and her husband have grown closer in the last eight years, but added that her biggest sacrifice has been anonymity. She said she wasn't sure if she's ready to be a private citizen.

""There's nowhere I can go in the world and just sit at a table and have a cup of coffee and watch the world,"" she said.

Toward the end, Winfrey returned to a question she had put to Michelle Obama eight years earlier, when she asked about Obama's prayers for her family.

Obama's response at the time, Winfrey said, was that ""we remain whole.""

""So now, I ask you, what is your prayer for our country?"" Winfrey continued.

""It's hope,"" Obama replied. ""My desire for this country is that we remain hopeful and that we find a place in our hearts to love each other. It's really simple  just opening up our hearts to others, making room.""",R
"Ahead of Pro-Trump Rally, KKK Members Claim They're 'Not White Supremacists'","PELHAM, N.C.  In today's racially charged environment, there's a label that even the KKK disavows: white supremacy.

Standing on a muddy dirt road in the dead of night near the North Carolina-Virginia border, masked Ku Klux Klan members claimed Donald Trump's election as president proves whites are taking back America from blacks, immigrants, Jews and other groups they describe as criminals and freeloaders. America was founded by and for whites, they say, and only whites can run a peaceful, productive society.

But still, the KKK members insisted in an interview with The Associated Press, they're not white supremacists, a label that is gaining traction in the country since Trump won with the public backing of the Klan, neo-Nazis and other white racists.

""We're not white supremacists. We believe in our race,"" said a man with a Midwestern accent and glasses just hours before a pro-Trump Klan parade in a nearby town. He, like three Klan compatriots, wore a robe and pointed hood and wouldn't give his full name, in accordance with Klan rules.

Claiming the Klan isn't white supremacist flies in the face of its very nature. The Klan's official rulebook, the Kloran  published in 1915 and still followed by many groups  says the organization ""shall ever be true in the faithful maintenance of White Supremacy,"" even capitalizing the term for emphasis.

Watchdog groups also consider the Klan a white supremacist organization, and experts say the groups' denials are probably linked to efforts to make their racism more palatable.

Still, KKK groups today typically renounce the term. The same goes for extremists including members of the self-proclaimed ""alt-right,"" an extreme branch of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism.

""We are white separatists, just as Yahweh in the Bible told us to be. Separate yourself from other nations. Do not intermix and mongrelize your seed,"" said one of the Klansmen who spoke along the muddy lane.

The Associated Press interviewed the men, who claimed membership in the Loyal White Knights of the KKK, in a nighttime session set up with help of Chris Barker, a KKK leader who confirmed details of the group's ""Trump victory celebration"" in advance of the event. As many as 30 cars paraded through the town of Roxboro, North Carolina, some bearing Confederate and KKK flags.

Barker didn't participate, though: He and a Klan leader from California were arrested hours earlier on charges linked to the stabbing of a third KKK member during a fight, sheriff's officials said. Both men were jailed; the injured man was recovering.

The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, which monitor white extremist organizations and are tracking an increase in reports of racist incidents since the election, often use the ""white supremacist"" label when describing groups like the Klan; white nationalism and white separatism are parts of the ideology. But what exactly is involved?

The ADL issued a report last year describing white supremacists as ""ideologically motivated by a series of racist beliefs, including the notion that whites should be dominant over people of other backgrounds, that whites should live by themselves in a whites-only society, and that white people have their own culture and are genetically superior to other cultures.""

That sounds a lot like some of the ideas espoused by today's white radicals, yet they reject the label. That's likely because they learned the lessons of one-time Klan leader David Duke, who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana this year, said Penn State University associate professor Josh Inwood.

""(There was) this peddling of kinder, softer white supremacy. He tried to pioneer a more respectable vision of the Klan,"" Inwood said.",R
Donald Trump invites press to off-the-record session at Mar-A-Lago,"On Sunday evening, Donald Trump invited reporters to an off-the-record session at his Mar-A-Lago residence, where hes spending the holidays.

Trump vows to eradicate Islamic terrorism in response to Berlin attack
The press pool covering him reported, Trump stopped by a staff off the record with reporters at Mar-a-Lago, mingling for about a half hour and according to [Trump press director] Stephanie Grisham decided to go to dinner afterwards. We are told we can report the fact that Trump and Melania stopped by the OTR with reporters.

It is not unusual for elected officials to hold off-the-record meetings with the press -- ostensibly to give journalists insight into the principals thinking on an issue. This particular session took place as journalists continue to protest the fact that Mr. Trump has yet to hold a news conference since his election. Its now been 145 days since his last news conference. He has, since the election, given interviews to CBS News, to New York Times reporters, and to Fox News, but the press conference he was to hold last week about the resolution of his business conflicts was postponed until the new year.  

Mike Allen, formerly of Politico and now of Axios, was there and sent a series of tweets about the meeting in the White and Gold ballroom, saying in one that Mr. Trump was relaxed and chatty and that pictures were allowed of the off-the-record session.


Many of the journalists who attended, including Allen, saw an uptick in outraged tweets aimed at them, though this one, from cartoonist Ann Telnaes, summed up the reaction visually.


In addition to Allen, APs Evan Vucci, Reuters Steve Holland and Jonathan Lucas, ABCs Katherine Faulders and Hallie Jackson, Jeremy Diamond and Noah Gray of CNN, Ali Vitali of NBC, the Washington Posts Jabin Botsford, the New York Times Nick Corasaniti, Buzzfeeds Adrian Carrasquillo and Politicos Tara Palmeri attended, among others. 

Though the president-elect has not yet held a press conference, hes hardly been silent since his election victory -- Mr. Trump is still tweeting regularly.",R
Texas kicking Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid funding,"AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas has given Planned Parenthood final notice of plans to cut off Medicaid funding, a move that federal judges have so far blocked other Republican-controlled states from making. 

Planned Parenthood responded Tuesday by saying it will also ask a court to stop Texas from defunding clinics in January. Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Kansas are among the states where judges have denied similar efforts.

People are donating to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's name
Planned Parenthood had previously received $3.1 million in Medicaid funding from the state of Texas, according to the notice that was obtained by the Texas Tribune. Planned Parenthood says its clinics serve nearly 11,000 women in Texas each year through Medicaid. 

Planned Parenthood will lose the Medicaid funding within 30 days. The organization has 15 days to appeal  by requesting an administrative hearing with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, according to the Tribune. 

Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards responded by calling Texas a cautionary tale for the rest of the nation. The move comes at a time when her organization is simultaneously fighting to stop Congress from also cutting off taxpayer dollars. President-elect Donald Trump has given mixed signals about his feelings toward the group.

Last week, the Obama administration barred states from denying federal family planning funds, although abortion opponents immediately said they would seek to repeal it when Mr. Trump takes office in January. ",R
"After violence abroad, Trump meeting with security adviser","PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump is planning to meet with his incoming national security adviser in the aftermath of a rattling day of violence around the world.

Trump appeared to jump ahead of investigators in blaming Islamic terrorists for deadly incidents Monday in Turkey and Germany and vowing anew to eradicate their regional and global networks. He called the brazen shooting of Russias ambassador to Turkey a violation of all rules of civilized order. He added that a radical Islamic terrorist had assassinated the diplomat, Andrei Karlov.

Turkish authorities identified the gunman as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a member of Ankaras riot police squad, and said he was later killed in a shootout with police. Altintas shouted in Turkish about the Syrian city of Aleppo and also yelled Allahu akbar, Arabic for God is great.

President-elect Trump describes mission to fight terrorism
As for Berlin, where at least 12 people were killed and nearly 50 hurt when a truck plowed through a Christmas market, Trump said the Islamic State group and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. A man held by German authorities after the violence was later released after a lack of evidence to connect him to the incident.

Trumps meeting scheduled Wednesday with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will come a day after Flynn and several other members of the incoming national security team met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Washington. Aides said the meeting was planned before the acts of violence, though they were discussed.

The gathering with Pence included retired Gen. John Kelly, Trumps nominee for head of the Department of Homeland Security; retired Gen. James Mattis, the pick for defense secretary; and Rex Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil and the intended nominee for secretary of state.

While Trump has assembled his Cabinet at a quick pace, the process to fill out top White House jobs has been slowed by infighting among advisers. Some of Trumps earliest advisers have expressed concern to the president-elect himself that they are getting boxed out in favor of those more closely aligned with incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has chaired the Republican National Committee.

Among those whose future is still in flux is Corey Lewandowski, Trumps controversial first campaign manager who was fired after clashing with the president-elects family. On Monday, Lewandowski met with Jared Kushner, Trumps influential son-in-law, and could still be offered a job in the administration, though potentially one that would keep him out of the West Wing - and away from the president.

The president-elects transition team has said it expects to announce some White House positions in the coming days.

Former FBI agent on how Berlin terror attack differs from Nice
Trump met Tuesday with candidates for his unfilled Cabinet positions, including prospective hires to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, a beleaguered agency that the Republican businessman has vowed to overhaul.

At Mar-a-Lago, Trumps palatial Florida estate, the president-elect met with Luis Quinonez, who runs a company with military and health care ties and is said to be under consideration for VA secretary. He also interviewed Toby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, who was a top contender to replace Eric Shinseki when he resigned from the VA in 2014. Cosgrove later withdrew from consideration.

Trump repeatedly pledged during the campaign to fix the woes at the department and said he would take care of great veterans. But he also came under scrutiny for being slow in paying out money raised for veterans groups and for suggesting that strong veterans dont need treatment for mental health problems.

Others said to be considered for the post include former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, Florida Rep. Jeff Miller and Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran and former CEO of Concerned Veterans for America.

Trump is also considering Jovita Carranza, who worked in President George W. Bushs administration, as his choice for U.S. trade representative. She served as deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration under Bush.

With just a handful of Cabinet posts to fill, Trump is facing some criticism for a lack of diversity in his senior team, which currently includes no Hispanics. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said Tuesday that it was deeply concerned at the lack of Hispanics considered for top jobs. Carranza was a member of Trumps Hispanic advisory council during the campaign.

Pence, meanwhile, met in Washington with former Texas state official Susan Combs, who served both as state agriculture commissioner and comptroller. Trump also needs to fill the Agriculture Department slot. Transition officials did not immediately confirm if Combs is up for that post.",R
"Key GOP senators join call for bipartisan Russia election probe, even as their leaders remain mum","Two Senate Republicans joined demands for a bipartisan probe into Russias suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald Trump as questions continue to mount about the president-elects expected decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia.

Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.)  the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  joined calls by incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Armed Services ranking Democrat Jack Reed (R.I.) for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U.S. elections. Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIAs private conclusion that Russias activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump.

Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American, the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning. Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.

This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security, they added.

But McCain and Graham  who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election  have often bucked Republican leaders, and their embrace of a wide-ranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), one of the more moderate Republicans in the upper chamber, suggested a bipartisan investigation may be useful toward achieving an objective accounting of any alleged meddling by foreign adversaries.

The purpose of any investigation, whether by the Obama administration or Congress, is not to question or relitigate the results of any past or present Presidential election, she said in a statement. Instead, any review must focus on the long overdue task of improving the defenses of the United States against cyber attacks, including those that might seek to affect or influence political campaign.

Another GOP senator  Sen. James Lankford (Okla.), who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee  agreed with McCain and Grahams decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U.S. elections.

Cybersecurity investigation of Russian interference cant be partisan, Lankford tweeted Sunday.

Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committees chairman, Richard Burr (R-N.C.), said Sunday that the panel will continue to conduct vigorous oversight of all intelligence matters.

But he made no specific mention of Russia, unlike Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said cyber threats by Americas rivals, including Russia, pose serious challenges that should not be politicized or viewed through a partisan lens.

Johnson said as chairman Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations panel he would continue to hold hearings based on fact  not innuendo  for the sole purpose of informing effective policy and appropriate countermeasures.

Republicans may be loath to join calls for such a wide-ranging investigation into Russias election-related activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as ridiculous. They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the president-elect before he is even inaugurated. Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he praised during the campaign.

I think its just another excuse. I dont believe it .?.?. No, I dont believe it at all, Trump said of the CIA charges on Fox News Sunday. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway echoed her boss on CBSs Face the Nation, saying that such allegations from the intelligence community were laughable and ridiculous.

Trump also played down the importance of receiving the daily intelligence briefing, a tradition for presidents and presidents-elect. He has received the briefings only sporadically since winning the election.

A U.S. intelligence official said it is concerning that intelligence on Russia relating to the election is being dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan.

The inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

[Trump denies CIA report that Russia intervened to help him win election]

McConnell himself has been notably silent since the Post report was published on Friday night, and his number-two, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), downplayed the significance of it in a series of tweets  although some of them suggested Congresss review of Russian actions should broaden.

All this news of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news, Cornyn tweeted Saturday.

The Texas Republican seemed to support, however, a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the U.S. election, retweeting the below tweet from Graham: Cyber-attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia  not just election influence.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday, said Sunday he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters, calling foreign intervention unacceptable.

For the most part, other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether  Putins government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary Clintons campaign.

At the same time, several Republican senators raised concerns about Trumps likely nomination of Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobils chief executive, as secretary of state due to his  ties to Putin. Republicans in a 52-to-48 Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed, should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination. Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat Tillerson.

The potential nomination sparked a backlash among the partys traditional hawks who oppose Putin, and some senior strategists feared that more than a handful of Republicans would outright oppose his nomination  requiring Trump to find Democratic support in order to confirm his potential Secretary of State.

Its a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat, McCain told CBSs Face the Nation.

Being a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted Sunday.

Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes. Over the weekend, several committee Democrats, including Sens. Robert Menendez (N.J.) and Christopher A. Coons (Del.), stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidate.

In a post on Facebook, Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state alarming and absurd, concluding that the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the Presidents Cabinet guiding our nations foreign policy.

Yet the committees chairman, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)  who was considered a possible pick for Trumps secretary of state  has said Tillerson would be a good choice.

If it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very good individual, Corker tweeted.

Should Tillerson make it to a floor vote, Democrats could not block the nomination alone. If Democrats stick together, Republicans must muster at least 50 of the 52 votes they will have to successfully confirm him, as Vice President-elect Mike Pence could cast the tiebreaking vote.

Graham has already also strongly hinted that he might oppose the nomination.

I dont know the man much at all, but lets put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then were gonna have some talkin, Graham said early Saturday morning. Well have some questions. I dont want to prejudge the guy but thats a bit unnerving.",R
Lawyer: 'Appalled' by FBI warrant that shook Clinton,"WASHINGTON  The FBI warrant that shook Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign in its final two weeks has been unsealed, and the lawyer who requested it says it offers ""nothing at all"" to merit the agency's actions leading up to the Nov. 8 election.

The warrant was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Los Angeles lawyer Randy Schoenberg, who wants to determine what probable cause the agency provided to suspect material on disgraced congressman Anthony Weiners computer might be incriminating to Clinton. Weiner is the estranged husband of Clintons top aide, Huma Abedin. Under the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure can only be granted when proof of probable cause of criminal findings has been documented.

The letter confirms news reports in late October that the FBI had detected non-content header information suggesting correspondence with accounts involved in its already-completed investigation of Clinton's private email server. The FBI request concludes there is probable cause to believe that the laptop contained evidence, contraband, fruits and/or items illegally possessed, without providing specifics.

""I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between"" Clinton and Abedin, Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY. It remains unknown ""why they thought they might find evidence of a crime, why they felt it necessary to inform Congress, and why they even sought this search warrant,"" he said. ""I am appalled."" The FBI's Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

Clinton campaign officials echoed Schoenberg's complaints Tuesday. Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that the ""unsealed filings regarding Huma's emails reveals Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time.""

New emails under review in Clinton case emerged from Weiner probe
FBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clinton's email
The FBI concluded in July that there was no clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws and that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Then, two weeks before the election, Comey sent a three-paragraph letter to Congress that said in the course of an unrelated investigation investigators found emails that appear to be pertinent to Clintons private email server. Comey also wrote that he could not assess whether the material was significant.

The letter was so vague that Clintons opponents seized on it to shift the narrative from a damaging drumbeat of news stories about Donald Trump, including his past treatment of women. Trump called it bigger than Watergate and predicted that the FBI would ""right the ship"" after previously deciding against criminal charges.

Comeys investigation was the primary cudgel for Trump and his supporters, who claimed  falsely  that Clinton was guilty of criminal activity. His large rallies regularly chanted Lock her up! and Clintons motorcade was greeted in city after city with angry crowds waving signs.

Abedins lawyers have also been requesting permission to review the warrant, which they say their client never saw and hadnt or even been alerted to, preventing them from responding publicly in the final days of the campaign. Two days before the election, Comey confirmed there was no new information.

At the same time, Comey was in possession of evidence showing Russia was hacking into the Democratic Party apparatus, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., accused him of holding back explosive information about Russian interference. The retiring senator said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits activity directed towards the success or failure of a candidate.

On Monday, former president Bill Clinton said his wife fought through everything, and she prevailed against it all. But she couldnt endure the combination of the FBIs interference and Russian meddling. At the end, we had the Russians and the FBI deal. But she couldnt prevail against that, Clinton told reporters in Albany.

He cited late-deciding voters breaking strongly against her enough to cost her Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Schoenberg said more information needs to be made public before the matter is put to rest. ""The FBI agents name has not been disclosed, but I think that it may be appropriate to find out his/her name and determine what the motivations were, since it must have been obvious to the FBI that there was no real probable cause to believe they would find evidence of a crime,"" he said in a follow-up email.

"Contradicting settled science, Donald Trump says ""nobody really knows"" on climate change","Donald Trump said again on Sunday that he is open-minded about climate change -- but also that nobody really knows the truth about the issue, which contradicts the fact that there is near-universal scientific agreement on the issue.

In an interview with Fox News Sunday, moderator Chris Wallace pointed out to Mr. Trump  that in the space of a week he bothmet with former Vice President Al Gore and appointed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier who has opposed many environmental regulations, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Where, Wallace asked, does Mr. Trump stands on climate change?

Im very open-minded. Im still open-minded, he said. Nobody really knows.

However, there is a near-universal scientific consensus that climate change is a real phenomenon -- despite continued opposition to the notion among primarily Republican politicians. NASAs website on climate change, for example, notes that approximately 97 percent of publishing climate scientists agree that human activities are very likely responsible for rising temperatures.

His comments came just days after his transition team created a questionnaire with 74 questions for Energy Department officials to identify employees who had been involved in international climate talks over the last five years, as well as employees who have helped develop Obama administration climate policies.

The questionnaire, obtained by CBS News and first reported by Bloomberg News, asks, for example, Which programs within [the Department of Energy] are essential to meeting the goals of President Obamas Climate Action Plan?

Mr. Trumps answer Sunday on the climate change issue is similar to the one he gave in a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times last month -- after a campaign in which Mr. Trump repeatedly insisted climate change was a hoax invented by China.

I have a very open mind, he said at the time. And Im going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and were going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind.

Still, Mr. Trump said his reason for choosing Pruitt -- whom many environmental groups immediately blasted -- was to speed up the process for permit approvals and other EPA business.

If you look at what Chinas doing. If you look at what -- I could name country after country, he said. You look at whats happening in Mexico where our people are just -- plants are being built and they dont wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? They build it like the following day or the following week. We cant let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.

As for the Paris Agreement, the landmark international climate agreement that went into effect this fall, Mr. Trump said he is studying the agreement -- but that he worries it will put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage. International energy and environment experts worry that Mr. Trump, who said earlier this year that he would tear up the Paris deal, could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy.

Paris, Im studying, he said. I do say this: I dont want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. And as you know, there are different times and different time limits on that agreement. I dont want that to give China, or other countries signing agreements an advantage over us.",R
Trump's choice for education secretary raises fears in Detroit,"Two years ago, Jonathan Clark was sending his four school-age kids to four different schools in Detroit.

We were driving 200 miles a week just to and from school, he said. His three oldest  all girls, ages 14 to 16  were enrolled at charters, privately run schools funded by the government that promise better educational outcomes.

Clark was able to send his kids to schools all over the city because of school choice, the policy that allows kids to get educated outside their home district. But Clark said the conditions at these charter schools were no different from whats typical of a public school in Detroit: a lack of resources needed to educate students, high teacher turnover, and low test scores.

These are all things they give bad marks to DPS [Detroit public schools] on, he said, but charters are doing the same.

Thats why Clark is alarmed by Donald Trumps nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the US Department of Education.

DeVos, a billionaire and conservative activist from the state, has been one of the strongest defenders in Michigan of expanding charter schools and choice.

DeVos and her husband, Dick, have long been a force in education policy efforts in Michigan, as well as other sensitive political issues  such as the Michigan legislatures 2012 decision to pass right-to-work legislation. The DeVoses have contributed at least $7m to state lawmakers and Michigans GOP party  including support for a failed $5m effort to pass a pro-school-voucher voter referendum in 2000.

Public education advocates who oppose DeVoss nomination point to Michigans education record  particularly in Detroit, where nearly half of students attend charters.

Since a quarter-century ago, charter advocates have pursued an agenda that has included a lift on the cap for how many can open in the state, as well as an expansion of school choice. Along the way, the states academic performance has dropped, and Detroit has probably felt the biggest impact.

Though charter advocates point to studies that suggest student gains have been made at charters, the citys disconnected array of schools has developed into a frenetic status quo. Just this year, the district has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, prompting teachers facing potential payless work days to stage mass protests, and a federal lawsuit is now attempting to assert a constitutional right to literacy  an argument couched in the dismal performance scores of Detroit students.

Whats more, the states policies and regulation of charters has been so lax, critics routinely refer to the citys educational landscape as the wild west. Indeed, a federal audit this year noted Michigans charter school law does not include provisions for regulating conflict-of-interest issues. The state also allows for-profit charters to be established, a practice prohibited elsewhere.

Since 1990, Detroits population has dropped nearly 35%, while its school districts attendance has plummeted nearly 75%  a signal of the proliferation of charters and use of choice in the city.

The situation in Michigan is such that even charter advocates criticize the states approach  and DeVoss devotion to maintaining it.

It doesnt matter that charter schools arent giving any of the things they promised 22 years ago, said Stephen Henderson, a Detroit native and editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, who, along with his two children, attended charters. She ... and her family funds any effort to block any changes or accountability or standards that would perhaps produce better results for us.

But the pick underscored the polarizing views of DeVos. In her home state, Michigans governor and attorney general echoed Trumps remarks about her qualifications.

Dan Quisenberry, president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies, downplayed criticisms of her background, saying her business experience and previous role as the Michigan GOP chairwoman showed she could lead a large organization and handle political issues.

Betsy is a person who will put kids before adults, he said. Shes going to put students and parents ahead of politics.

Michigan indeed has some high-performing charter schools, including in Detroit. Many supporters point to a 2013 Stanford study that found charter students in the state learned at a faster rate than those in public schools, with two months of gains, or three months in Detroit. Still, the study found that slightly more than half of Detroit charter schools failed to perform significantly better in math and reading than counterparts, some even worse.

This summer, charter school advocates  including DeVoss group, the Great Lakes Education Project  agreed to some additional accountability measures as part of a $617m investment to overhaul the governance of Detroit public schools. Schools must now be assessed regularly, and new schools accredited.

But a provision to create a commission overseeing Detroit schools was stripped from the legislation after intense lobbying by charter advocates and DeVos.

What they feared was the accountability, Henderson, 46, said.

DeVos  whose father-in-law founded Amway, a marketing company that previously settled tax fraud accusations for $25m  has long leveraged her wealth to target Republicans who have not boosted her education agenda. After the commission was derailed, DeVos donated $1.45m to state Republican lawmakers over a two month period.

Henderson said GOP lawmakers had told him that in the runup to the decision to axe the Detroit commission, DeVos explicitly stated that she wouldnt donate to their campaign efforts if they didnt flip their votes on the issue.

Trumps transition team declined to make DeVos available for an interview and did not provide comment for this story.

Quisenberry said critics  namely, teachers unions  who point to DeVos political influence usually are involved very much in the same influence on the other side

What the [Detroit commission] was about was whose political influence was going to win out, he said. The teachers union was very involved.

Clark believes the commission would have addressed the distribution and quality of of schools in the city - in his neighborhood, there is just one operational school for 3,000 kids.

If schools in our neighborhood were open, and up to standards, and producing a quality educational experience, then we wouldnt have had to go to four different schools all over the city, Clark said.

Clark now sends his three older kids to private school. But he knows that is off the table for many other parents in the city, where 40% of residents live below the poverty line.

What about the parents who arent in that position?",R
Intelligence figures fear Trump reprisals over assessment of Russia election role,"Legislators overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies have told the Guardian they will be vigilant about reprisals from Donald Trump over an internal assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to ensure Trumps victory.

Fears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus.

When the president-elects transition team is attempting to discredit the entire intelligence community [IC], it has never been more important for the IC and Congress to guard against possible political pressure or retaliation against intelligence analysts, Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told the Guardian.

Like his Democratic colleagues on the panel, Wyden is pressing Barack Obama for additional public disclosures revealing Russian electoral interference. Such pressure has placed the CIA and other intelligence agencies between the incoming president to whom they will soon answer and a chorus of legislators, mostly but not exclusively Democrats, who consider the Russia hack a national emergency.

It is not possible to gauge precisely how deep fears of retaliation run within the intelligence world. Two currently serving intelligence officers told the Guardian this weekend they had not heard their colleagues express such concerns.

One noted that civil-service laws prevented Trump from launching a purge, but also called attention to a report that Trump is combing through the energy department bureaucracy to identify people who have attended climate change policy conferences.

Former intelligence officers told the Guardian they considered retaliation by Trump to be all but a certainty after he is sworn into office next month. Trump still has several appointments to make at the highest levels of the intelligence apparatus, picks which are likely to be bellwethers for the new presidents attitudes toward the agencies.

There is not just smoke here. There is a 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid
Glenn Carle, former CIA officer
There is not just smoke here. There is a blazing 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid, and Trump is standing half-burnt and holding a match, said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer and interrogator.

The facts hurt, Trump wont like the truth, and he will without question seek to destroy those individuals or organizations that say or do anything that he thinks harm his precious grandiosity.

After congressional Democrats called for additional briefings and public disclosures about an intelligence consensus that Russia made a deliberate decision to intervene in the election, Barack Obama ordered a new review of the evidence.

On Friday, the Washington Post reported that intelligence sources believe the Russians decided to penetrate the Democratic National Committees digital networks with the goal of aiding Trump, not merely to spread uncertainty about the outcome of the election.

In response, Trump attacked the credibility of the intelligence agencies on which he will rely for early warning of security emergencies and geopolitical developments. His transition team said in a statement: These are the same people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Trump cannot abide the idea that Russian hacking helped his campaign and was lashing out in a manner that undermined confidence in his handling of intelligence.

If Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now, and demean the hard-working and patriotic Americans who produced it, I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths, Schiff said.

Will he accept the best insights of our agencies, or punish them for daring to contradict his assumptions?

Trumps clash with the CIA comes at a moment of acute turmoil within intelligence circles. Obama officials jeopardized the tenure of National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers in a seemingly thwarted bureaucratic reorganization of the US surveillance and cybersecurity apparatus. Congressional sources have told the Guardian they expect to hold a public hearing on the issue in January.

Should Trump go through with the reshuffle, it will leave him appointing an NSA director as well as a director of national intelligence, after James Clapper announced his resignation last month. Trump has also been noncommittal about retaining the FBI director, James Comey, whose bureau houses significant sympathy for Trump.

Congressional Republicans are in an uncomfortable position, between a president of their own party and Russia, a traditional adversary.

Devin Nunes, a California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said on Saturday Russian electoral hacking was no surprise. He also blamed Obama for coming late to the threat out of delusions of resetting relations with Russia  a policy that Trump is also pursuing.

On Sunday, anti-Trump GOP hawks Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered a different path, joining with leading Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to plead for a bipartisan inquiry into the alleged Russian hacking, which they said endangered the country.

We have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society, the senators said in a joint statement.

Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.

 Trump: reports that Russia influenced US election are ridiculous
Also on Sunday, Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat on the investigations-heavy House oversight committee, pressured the Republican committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz, and speaker of the house Paul Ryan to join us now in our effort to launch a robust and truly bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in our election that puts our nations interests over the interests of any political party.


FBI covered up Russian influence on Trump's election win, Harry Reid claims

Carle, the retired CIA officer, said Trumps temperament had played into Russias hands and put the president-elect on a collision course with the CIA.

He said: Look, in my professional assessment as an intelligence officer, Trump has a reflexive, defensive, monumentally narcissistic personality, for whom the facts and national interest are irrelevant, and the only thing that counts is whatever gives personal advantage and directs attention to himself.

He is about the juiciest intelligence target an intelligence office could imagine. He groans with vulnerabilities. He will only work with individuals or entities that agree with him and build him up, and he is a shockingly easy intelligence target to manipulate.

Were Trump an intelligence officer himself, Carle said, he would be removed and possibly charged with having accepted the clandestine support of a hostile power to the harm of the United States.

A senior intelligence official who was not cleared to talk to reporters supported the push to declassify additional material on the serious matter of the alleged Russian electoral interference, since it happened on our watch.",R
"Trump Decries His Foundation's Closure, Overstating Its Giving","President-elect Donald Trump is lashing out in defense of his charitable foundation as he prepares to shutter it before taking the oath of office next month.

Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back
THE TWO-WAY
Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back
And in doing so, Trump incorrectly stated the charitable reach of the Donald J. Trump Foundation.

In a series of tweets Monday evening, Trump said he had given millions to the foundation he began in 1987 and that all of the money raised went to ""wonderful charities.""

I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016

The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016
But extensive reporting over the past year has shown those claims to be overstated. According to the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, who has researched the foundation's donations and expenses for several months, Trump and his companies have given about $6 million to the charity since its launch, according to tax records up to 2015.

However, the president-elect has not given anything to the foundation from 2009 until 2014; his businesses gave to the foundation in 2015 for the first time in several years, according to the Post.

In fact, the two largest donors were professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5 million to the foundation from 2007 until 2009. Trump has nominated Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration.

And as Fahrenthold reported during the campaign, not all of the money was solely for charitable purposes. In many cases, spending benefited Trump and his business interests. Trump used his foundation's money to buy a 6-foot-tall portrait of himself for $20,000, and had earlier bought another portrait for $10,000, the Post's reporting showed. He also used the foundation's money to buy an autographed Tim Tebow Denver Broncos helmet for $12,000.

Trump tapped his foundation to help settle lawsuits for his businesses. In one case, Palm Beach, Fla., agreed to forgive fines for Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club if he made a $100,000 donation to a veterans' charity. In another instance, Trump settled a case involving one of his New York golf courses to make a $158,000 donation to a charity of the plaintiff's choosing.

""So if Trump is using this money basically to save his businesses, the money isn't helping people. That's a violation of the letter and the spirit of law,"" Fahrenthold told NPR's All Things Considered on Sunday.

Trump announced on Christmas Eve that ""to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.""

But Trump cannot shutter the foundation just yet since it's under investigation by the New York attorney general, according to the office's spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York in October, saying it wasn't registered by law to be able to do so in the state.

And last year Trump had to pay a $2,500 fine to the IRS when he used $25,000 of the foundation's money to donate to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, she was weighing whether or not to pursue an investigation into Trump University; ultimately, she decided not to, and this year was a vocal surrogate for Trump.

RealClearPolitics also reported in October that many of the Trump Foundation's donations in recent years went to top conservative or policy groups that could aid Trump as he prepared for a White House run.

'Saving Lives' Or 'Selling Access'? Explaining The Clinton Foundation

'Saving Lives' Or 'Selling Access'? Explaining The Clinton Foundation
Throughout the campaign, Trump took sharp aim at his opponent Hillary Clinton's own family foundation, claiming it was a pay-to-play vehicle for the Democratic nominee and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

""It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office,"" Trump said at an August rally in Texas. ""They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money."" Those claims have not been borne out by evidence.

In August, the Clintons vowed to drastically reduce the size of their foundation to avoid appearances of conflict. They denied any insinuation of pay-to-play and defended the work of the Clinton Foundation.

At the time, RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, ""If everything was above board while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department as the Clintons have said, then why change a thing?""

But now it's Trump and his family who have come under fire for some of the same alleged behaviors. An AP investigation found that Trump's son Eric "" has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity's payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump's private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships.""

 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016
Eric Trump announced last week he would also close his personal foundation after it was auctioning off a coffee with his sister, Ivanka, who is expected to have considerable influence in her father's White House. The president-elect also tweeted about that last Friday, saying it was a ""ridiculous shame"" that Eric would have to stop fundraising for his foundation, which gave much of its money to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.


Back in October, NPR's Joel Rose compared the Trump and Clinton foundations and found some marked differences. While the Clinton Foundation does have hundreds of employees and a large budget, it spent almost 90 cents of every dollar received on charitable causes, such as HIV and malaria prevention in Africa. It's a public charity, meaning it mostly raises money from other people and organizations (including a gift from the Trump Foundation in 2009). And while it did accept money from foreign donors, some of whom wanted meetings when Clinton was secretary of state, ""there's no evidence that big donors got any special favors from the State Department,"" Rose reported.

The Trump Foundation is a private foundation, originally intended to give away Trump's own money. But, as noted earlier, he stopped making personal contributions about eight years ago.

""The Trump Foundation has engaged in documented, flagrant acts of violation,"" said Pamela Mann, a former head of the charities bureau in the New York attorney general's office, told Rose. ""That's really different.""",R
"In Reversal, Gambian President Rejects Loss And Calls For New Election","After publicly conceding electoral defeat last week, President Yahya Jammeh of Gambia has reversed course and is calling for a new election.

Jammeh has ruled the tiny West African country since seizing power in a coup in 1994, and his public concession to President-elect Adama Barrow on Dec. 2 led to hopes of the first peaceful transition of power in Gambia since it became independent from the U.K. in 1965.

On Friday, Jammeh said the Independent Electoral Commission made errors in vote tallies.

""In the same way that I accepted faithfully the results, believing that the IEC was independent and honest and reliable, I hereby reject the results in totality,"" Jammeh said in a televised speech.

He also said there were other irregularities and problems in the electoral process.

""Our investigations reveal that in some cases, voters were told that the opposition has already won and there was no need for them to vote,"" Jammeh said.

Last week, supporters of the opposition took to the streets to celebrate Barrow's win. Jammeh's allegations are now ""plunging Gambia into confusion and uncertainty,"" NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports.

President-elect Barrow responded, telling reporters, ""The outgoing president has no constitutional authority to reject the result of the election and order for fresh elections to be held,"" Reuters reports. ""I urge him to change his current position and accept the verdict of the people in good faith for the sake of the Gambia, our homeland, whose people deserve peace and freedom and prosperity,"" he added to The Associated Press.

The U.S. joined international bodies in condemning the announcement.

""This action is a reprehensible and unacceptable breach of faith with the people of The Gambia and an egregious attempt to undermine a credible election process and remain in power illegitimately,"" State Department spokesman Mark C. Toner said in a press release.

The Economic Community of West African States, the U.N. and African Union echoed the sentiment in a joint statement:

""They call on the government of The Gambia to abide by its constitutional responsibilities and international obligations. It is fundamental that the verdict of the ballots should be respected, and that the security of the president -elect Adama Barrow, and that of all Gambian citizen be fully ensured.""

Wire services report the streets of the capital Banjul were calm Saturday, with a heavy presence of police and soldiers. Gambians closed down shops and stayed home out of fear of violence.

Human rights groups have criticized Jammeh for abuses during his 22-year rule. In its 2016 report, Human Rights Watch said his government ""frequently committed serious human rights violations including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture against those who voiced opposition to the government,"" creating ""a climate of fear within Gambia.""

On Saturday, the organization retweeted a statement from deputy program director Babatunde Olugboji saying they were ""deeply concerned.""

Diplomats told Reuters that it's unclear what international organizations plan to do, but there is a precedent for military intervention. In 1981, they note, the surrounding country of Senegal sent in troops to stop a coup in Gambia.

Opposition leader Mai Ahmad Fatty urged calm. ""We are working round the clock to restore sanity,"" he told the AP. ""We have the full support of our people. The world is with us.""",R
No Government Shutdown: Senate Passes Funding Bill After Democrats Back Down,"Senate Democrats dropped their objections Friday night to a short-term-funding bill to keep the government running, and the bill passed less than an hour before the midnight deadline.

It's become a familiar year-end act for Congress: passing a short-term-funding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months. This funding measure, which passed 63-36, runs out in April.

Despite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday, the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate, where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting miners.

The stopgap includes $45 million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners, whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, led by West Virginia's Joe Manchin, wanted a full-year extension, but with little leverage and a shutdown looming, they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four months.

""Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""But we'll be back at it in April, and I think it's highly unlikely that we'll take it away.""

With House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday  and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations  Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdown.

The spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April 28. Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans will have more sway over how roughly $1 trillion is spent on federal agencies and programs.

The bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year 2017 spending bills, because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next year.

Since the spending bill is a must-pass measure, it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures. For instance, Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trump's defense secretary nominee, retired Gen. James Mattis.

For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress must waive a law that requires a seven-year cooling-off period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post. Mattis retired in 2013.

Democrats objected to the language, but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post. The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and it will need to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.

Mattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed, barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation process.

The measure also includes just over $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Funding, better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

An additional $4.1 billion is directed to disaster relief, including recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew.

Democrats also secured funding to assist the Flint, Mich., community with repairing its drinking water systems. Some $170 million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and children.

Congress approved a biomedical research bill this week, and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation, such as $352 million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and $500 million to states to combat the opioid epidemic.

The measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010.",R
Senate Democrats plan to run their Trump playbook against Tillerson,"Congress is preparing to do major battle next month over President-elect Donald Trumps secretary-of-state nominee, Rex Tillerson, in a brewing proxy fight over Trumps potential financial conflicts of interest and his unconventional foreign policy.

The official sparring is expected to take place on Jan. 11, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to hold a two-part hearing to grill Tillerson over his tenure as ExxonMobils chief executive and what many lawmakers see as unseemly links to Russia.

But behind the scenes on Capitol Hill, the strategizing has already begun.

Democrats do not think they stand much chance of stopping Tillerson from being confirmed. But they plan to press the top diplomat-designate to commit to full divestiture from Exxon and detail how he would pursue a different approach to the world as secretary of state, in what one Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity to candidly discuss strategy called a very thorough, tough vetting. As they have with Trump, Democrats plan to focus sharply on potential conflicts of interest deriving from Tillersons finances, as well as his views on critical foreign-policy matters.

Its a grilling they would happily give Trump, if only they had reason to drag him before a congressional committee.

Already, the minority party is railing against Republicans for refusing to demand Tillerson produce his tax returns. Their frustration stems from Tillersons response to a routine question about tax returns on the Foreign Relations Committees pre-hearing questionnaire. According to a Senate Democratic aide and a Trump transition team spokesman, Tillerson said he stood ready to provide only tax return information for himself and his wife for the previous three years. That means its possible Tillerson isnt willing to provide complete returns.

Democrats have demanded that all Trumps Cabinet nominees release their tax returns  something Trump himself steadfastly refused to do during the campaign, because, he said, the returns were under routine audit.

Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said the GOP would not break with years of precedent to compel Tillerson to turn over his tax returns without good reason, no matter how loud the clamor from Democrats. Unless there was a case where theres some irregularity thats known, the committee just does not ask for tax returns, Corker said in an interview.

Corker said Tillerson is not going to be the proxy [for Trump], because were not going to ask for tax returns.

I understand there are a number of Democrats who are very upset about President-elect Trump not putting his tax returns, Corker said. But thats not going to change the way we go about our committee process.

Senate Democrats believe they can fight miniature versions of the political battles they are waging with Trump during the confirmation hearings for his Cabinet choices  particularly those such as Tillerson who hail from the private sector. They intend to focus on Tillersons four-decade career at a major oil conglomerate and what they  and some Republicans  see as questionable ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several Democratic members of the committee have said they also plan to ask Tillerson about human rights and climate change in light of his Exxon work.

Many lawmakers are leaning on Trump to fully divest from his companies because his wide-ranging business empire lends itself at the very least to an appearance of conflicts of interest. Democrats argue Tillersons business career raises similar questions.

Just how thorny those conflicts may be wont be clear until the committee receives Tillersons financial disclosure statements, documents that Corker expects to have before the end of 2016. Corker plans to give other committee members a copy of the disclosure as soon as we have it, providing ample time to review what is expected to be a very extensive document.

Committee Democrats are planning to scour Tillersons financials once they receive them and are exploring options to beef up their resources by borrowing tax and financial experts from other corners of the Hill or seconding Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department employees to help, according to an aide.

The all-in effort is vital, they argue, because unlike many previous secretaries of state, Tillerson has not had to publicize details about his personal finances. If confirmed, Tillerson would be the first secretary of state in decades who has not previously worked as a public servant or a member of the military.

This proposed nominee for secretary of state will likely be asked more questions than normal. Secretary Kerry was somebody that we knew. Secretary Clinton was somebody that we knew, Corker said. Since [Tillerson] will be up under the hood advising the president on foreign policy, a president who hasnt been involved in foreign policy in his business life, we certainly want to understand fully the kind of advice he would be giving the president as secretary of state.

Part of the logic behind planning a two-part hearing (one session in the morning and one in the afternoon), as Corker put it, is so there can be plenty, plenty, plenty of time for people to learn everything they want to from Tillerson.

A particular point of concern for Democrats and Republicans will be Tillersons relationship and business dealings with Putin, who awarded him the Kremlins Order of Friendship in 2013. Tillerson also opposed sanctions that the United States imposed on Russia in 2014 as a reaction to the annexation of Crimea and Moscows support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, arguing that Exxon lost $1 billion from the policy change.

On Thursday, Corker had a 30-minute conversation with Tillerson in which he questioned him about Russia, with the bulk of that conversation focusing on sanctions. He came away with the impression that Tillerson had no interest in ripping up existing sanctions on Russia, even if he criticized them as Exxons CEO.

That would be hugely problematic to this one senator, if I felt that was how we were going to begin the relations with Russia, Corker said, referring to himself. He noted the conversation alleviated some of the concerns he harbored about Tillersons relationship with the Kremlin.

Corker said he encouraged Tillerson to start calling other lawmakers on his committee. Tillerson and lead Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Ben Cardin (Md.) also spoke by phone Thursday, but a spokesman for Cardin would not detail what was discussed.

On Tuesday, Tillerson was in Washington, where he met with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who endorsed his nomination. He hopes to meet with as many senators as possible to discuss his nomination, according to the Trump transition team.

I think, at least I hope, that when these meetings take place that were going to see a Rex Tillerson that has a standard view of Russias malicious activities, nefarious activities, Corker said. I got a good sense of how hed [approach] Russia and Putin, and it was certainly different, if you will, than the picture of him toasting Putin with champagne.

Several key GOP senators  including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.)  have expressed concerns that Tillersons ties to Russia could be a dangerous echo of Trumps seeming affinity for Putin. Those concerns have taken on even more urgency in wake of CIA allegations that Russia attempted to tilt the election to Trump.

Since the president-elect selected Tillerson, Trumps transition team has been rolling out foreign policy heavyweights such as Bob Gates, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and Dick Cheney to vouch for Tillersons global bona fides. Gates, Rice and Hadley run a consulting firm that has Exxon is a client.

Only one Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee  Rubio  has publicly criticized Tillerson over his Kremlin ties, and he communicated those concerns directly to Corker before the nomination was formally announced.

Democrats need only persuade one Republican to oppose Tillerson to block his nomination in committee. But it is still possible he could get to a floor vote even if the committee rejects him. In the past, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reported out nominations unfavorably, a procedure that expresses the members discontent without blocking the full Senate from voting. In 1983, the full Senate confirmed President Ronald Reagans Arms Control and Disarmament Agency nominee, Kenneth Adelman, despite his rejection by the panel.

But Corker expressed confidence that Tillerson would pass the committees test, even if his track record as an oil-company CEO gives members pause.

My sense is, based on the conversation we had, hes going to very much understand that his job now is to pursue our countrys national interest, Corker said.",R
Judge unseals warrant for search of Anthony Weiner's computer,"A federal judge in New York has unsealed the search warrant obtained by the FBI to search Anthony Weiners computer for emails related to Secretary Clintons private server.

The warrant was issued on Oct. 30, just two days after FBI Director James Comey had sent a letter to Congress revealing the possible existence of new emails related to the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server.

The Department of Justice had previously announced that the investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information was closed, with a decision not to bring charges against anyone. Comeys letter to Congress said the new emails were discovered as part of an unrelated investigation, but he did not name or give details about the other investigation.

FBI combs through Weiner's computer
According to the warrant, law enforcement officials had asked the judge to authorize the search of a silver Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series laptop computer. The warrant states that those officials had information indicating that there were thousands of emails on the laptop that could be related to the Clinton investigation.

The FBIs application for the search warrant said that the laptop had never been authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information and that a complete forensic analysis and review of the device would allow the FBI to determine whether classified information had been mishandled or if the device had been hacked. 

The warrant was unsealed after E. Random Schoenberg sued to unseal the search warrant. He made it clear he was not interested in the unrelated investigation and was only seeking the warrant for the emails related to Secretary Clinton.

Huma Abedin challenges the FBI
In deciding whether to unseal the warrant, the judge noted that Clinton has little remaining privacy interest in the release of her documents identify her as the subject of her investigation.

The Department of Justice initially opposed the unsealing, then withdrew its opposition and instead asked only that the documents be unsealed with certain redactions. The warrant was redacted to hide the identity of the subject of that other investigation  who has been independently confirmed to be Anthony Weiner. The redactions also protect the identity of the law enforcement agents who worked on the case and applied for the warrant.

Lawyers for Huma Abedin filed a letter in the case saying that the government never provided Abedin or her estranged ex-husband Anthony Weiner with a copy of the warrant.

Under federal law the officer executing the warrant must give a copy to the person whose property is taken.  This case is slightly more complicated by the fact that the laptop had already been confiscated for the other investigation, a sexting scandal involving Weiner and a minor.",R
"After Diplomat's Killing, Russia Doubles Down On Ties With Turkey","Tuesday was supposed to be a day of triumph for Russian diplomacy, when Russia aimed to replace the United States as the indispensable power in the Middle East. Instead, it became a day of mourning, with a Turkish honor guard in Ankara loading the flag-draped coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov onto a Moscow-bound plane.

Karlov, who was assassinated in an Ankara art gallery Monday evening, had been given the delicate mission of patching up relations after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane last year. On Tuesday, Karlov's efforts were to be crowned by a meeting in Moscow of the foreign and defense ministers of Russia, Turkey and Iran  and the rise of a new power constellation in the Middle East.

Those talks went ahead despite his death. Afterward, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared the three-country format ""the most effective"" in resolving the Syrian conflict, since his talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had run aground. Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, accused Russia and Iran of bearing responsibility for ""atrocities"" committed during the Syrian government's assault on the city of Aleppo.

With a lame-duck administration in the White House for the next month, Russia is using territorial gains in Syria to seize the diplomatic initiative as well. Because the Syrian government's retaking of Aleppo has happened so fast, Lavrov agreed to move up the Moscow meeting with his Turkish and Iranian colleagues by a week.

That's why the reaction to Karlov's murder  by an off-duty Turkish policeman who shouted about avenging the carnage in Aleppo before being shot to death himself  was practically unanimous in Moscow. The official line from Russian President Vladimir Putin on down was that the assassination in Ankara was a ""provocation"" meant to derail the talks.


Members of a Turkish honor guard carry the coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov at the airport in Ankara.

When Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24 warplane along the Turkey-Syria border in November 2015, Putin's response was fast and furious. Diplomatic and economic relations were put on hold until last summer, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally issued an apology.

On Monday, the blame in Moscow for the ambassador's killing was assigned to unnamed forces that are opposed to Russia and Turkey's rapprochement. Putin talked on the phone with Erdogan, who agreed to let in a team of Russian investigators.

Putin needs Erdogan, and Erdogan needs Putin. The two leaders are facing isolation from traditional partners because of their policies against domestic opponents and militant nostalgia for bygone empires. What to do about Syria  once a bone of contention between Russia and Turkey  has become an opportunity for both countries to act as power brokers in a global crisis.

The importance of that relationship is clear from the number of contacts the two countries have had since Erdogan's conciliatory visit to Russia back in August. In the space of the past month, Putin has been on the phone with Erdogan half a dozen times, and the Turkish leader is expected to travel to Russia again in January.

Just a little more than a year ago, Putin was accusing Erdogan of ""a stab in the back"" and estimated ISIS oil sales via Turkey in the hundreds of millions  if not billions  of dollars.

Now, responsibility for Karlov's assassination is being attributed to powers farther afield.

""Murder of our ambassador is continuation of information war against Russia. Media hysteria created conditions for it. Info attacks lead to terrorist attacks,"" Russian senator Alexei Pushkov tweeted on Tuesday.

Russian nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who happens to hold a degree in Turkish studies, didn't shy away from blaming the West directly.

""Turkey is turning away from the West. That's disadvantageous for certain Western intelligence agencies,"" Zhirinovsky said on state television Monday night.

The European Union and NATO are afraid that Russia will join forces with Iran and Turkey, he said, presenting the West with a formidable counterweight. So far, Karlov's efforts to that end have not been in vain.",R
"Carl Paladino, Trump campaign N.Y. co-chair, says his derogatory Obama remarks were a ""mistake""","ALBANY, N.Y. - A businessman who co-chaired the Trump campaign in New York state said Tuesday his recent derogatory statements about President Barack Obama and his wife werent meant for publication but were nevertheless inappropriate and a mistake.

Carl Paladino said he intended his email response to a weekly alternative publications survey to only go to a couple friends, not the newspaper. He said he mistakenly hit reply on his computer instead of forward.

The millionaire developer told Artvoice last week he hoped President Obama would die from mad cow disease and Michelle Obama would return to being a male.

In Paladinos Tuesday statement, first reported on Buffalos WBEN radio, he apologizes to minorities, saying he never intended to hurt them with his anti-Obama remarks. The comments sparked outrage from various political circles, including Trumps transition team, which called the developers comments absolutely reprehensible.

Paladinos comments even drew a rebuke from his own son William, who runs the familys development firm. The younger Paladino called the statements disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary.

The fathers earlier comments about the president prompted at least two petitions, one calling for his removal from the Buffalo school board and the other seeking the removal of his name from a student town house at St. Bonaventure University, his alma mater and recipient of more than $1 million in donations from Carl Paladino over the years.

Paladino, a school board member since 2013, also said he wont resign his elected position on the board.

No, Im not leaving the school board, he said in the statement, not when its time to help implement the real choice elements of Trumps plan for education reform.

The board is holding a special meeting Thursday to discuss board member conduct. In New York, school board members typically can only be removed by the state education commissioner.

Paladino, 70, unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010 as a Republican. The Democrat who defeated him, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called the comments about the Obamas racist, ugly and reprehensible.

Paladino made the comments Friday in response to an Artvoice survey that asked local artists, performers and business owners for their New Years wish list.

Asked what he would most like to happen in 2017, Paladino responded that he hoped Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a cow, dies and is buried in a cow pasture. 

Asked who he would like to see go away, he said Michelle Obama. 

Id like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla, he wrote. 

In an emailed statement to the AP, Paladino, 70, claimed his comments had nothing to do with race but instead reflected his opinion of the presidents performance in office. 

Merry Christmas and tough luck if you dont like my answer, he wrote. 

As recently as August, Paladino falsely claimed Mr. Obama was not Christian, telling the New York Observer that to average Americans, There is no doubt he is a Muslim. 

And in 2010, Paladino was criticized after it was revealed he had forwarded to friends racially charged emails that depicted Mr. Obama as a pimp. 

Paladino made no mention of any computer mistakes in a statement he released Friday after the publication posted his comments on its website. Instead, that statement ripped the Obamas, calling the president a yellow-bellied coward and claiming the first lady hated America before her husband won the White House.",R
What the intelligence briefing says about Obama's presidency  and Trump's,"WASHINGTON  The very first President's Intelligence Checklist  the predecessor to what's now known as the President's Daily Briefing  was delivered to President John F. Kennedy on a June Saturday in 1961. Typewritten on eight pages of 8.5-by-8-inch paper and stamped ""For the President Only  Top Secret,"" it contained 14 two-sentence briefs culled from diplomatic, military, intelligence and press sources, six shorter notes, and maps of Laos and the Congo.

Today, President Obama receives the document on an iPad. The articles are somewhat longer and sometimes have dissenting opinions. The maps can be interactive, and the briefings can include video.

The differences aren't just technological. After serving 10 presidents  and now preparing to brief the 11th, President-elect Donald Trump  the President's Daily Briefing has had to adjust to the reading habits and decision-making styles of each commander in chief.

And the ways in which it's produced, read and discussed provide a rare insight into how presidents approach national security issues.

""Its the only standing meeting he has every day. Even if we dont have the meeting, he gets the document,"" said Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes. ""Everyday there's the possibility that he'll see something that will cause him to move the entire U.S. government in a new direction. There's nothing else like that.""

For Obama, the PDB process paints a portrait of a methodical president who's often disdainful of raw, unfiltered intelligence in favor of more analytical perspective. He encourages dissenting opinions. He's interested in ""open source"" intelligence  including press accounts and, increasingly, social media  in addition to old-fashioned spycraft and intercepted communications.

President-elect Trump has yet to make a formal mark on intelligence. He's still getting a daily intelligence briefing designed for, and catered to, Obama. He's reading it largely as a courtesy by the incumbent president, part of a bipartisan tradition dating back to President Harry Truman.

But Trump has already suggested a different style of receiving intelligence. For the first month, he received in-person intelligence briefings only once a week, although his transition team now says it's three times a week.

But Trump himself has suggested a more ad hoc system of being updated only when major developments warrant.

""I get it when I need it,"" Trump told Fox News Sunday.

""I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,"" he said. ""I don't need that. But I do say, 'If something should change, let us know.' ""

In skipping daily briefings, Trump shows ambivalence toward intel agencies
Aides: Trump gets frequent classified briefings
Obama has said much the same about his daily briefing  albeit much later in his presidency.

""Over the years, you accumulate knowledge,"" Obama said in a YouTube interview earlier this year. ""Now, I've got enough of a baseline of knowledge. I've seen problems come up before, I've seen patterns that have emerged. I might not have to go into the briefing book as deeply as I did. ... I'm skimming. I'm looking at, are there significant differences?""

The frequency, the duration, the format, the depth, the subject matter  even the distribution list  are all up to the president.

In a book published earlier this year, former CIA officer David Priess argued that the PDB has had to adapt to each president who has receives it  and will continue to evolve to meet the president's personality, learning style and priorities.

""If a new president comes in and he wants the PDB presented through interpretive dance, he or she will get that,"" said Priess, author of The President's Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings. ""There will be a whole lot of intelligence officers taking dancing lessons.""

The President's Daily Briefing is what its name implies, Priess said.

""It is brief. Everything is not going to make it in. Its daily. If its not breaking, or not current, it doesnt get in,"" he said. ""But the most important word is 'president.' Is this deserving of his attention?""

That's a question that the intelligence community is constantly trying to reassess. And the transition period is a critical time for the incoming president to get up to speed on intelligence issues  and for the intelligence community to get to know the president-elect.

Current and former national security officials say frequent, in-person briefings with the president  and the president-elect  are an essential part of making sure the commander in chief is well-informed.

""There is a certain amount of trial and error to really settle in to what the new team wants,"" former CIA director Michael Hayden said. In his book, Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror, he describes what the intelligence community crudely refers to as the ""aw, s---"" moment.

It's attempt by intelligence officials to challenge the worldview of the president-elect's political advisers with a dose of reality. Hayden calls it ""phenomenon of the unpleasant fact.""

""That's when the intelligence guys give the president information and analysis that cuts across the policy or politics grain of the administration. You're telling them something they dont want to hear and dont want to believe,"" he said.

And it's important to do that in an in-person briefing, as opposed to the written product. ""You have to shake the preferred narrative of the policymaker,"" Hayden said. ""And you need the ability to do that face to face, and to do it with your tone, and your words and your body language to communicate, as opposed to just throwing it over the transom.""

When Obama first took office, the intelligence community grumbled that Obama  or at least his national security staff  wanted the reports so brief that they called them ""PDB haiku.""

Hayden's early briefings of Obama (he was replaced three weeks into Obama's presidency) were ""far less tactical"" than the briefings President George W. Bush was receiving.

But Michael Leiter, who directed the National Counterterrorism Center under both Bush and Obama, said he saw Obama grow in his use of intelligence from those early months.

""His inclination from the start was less about the tactics and more about the strategy, and more about how the U.S. was perceived in the world and interacted in the world,"" he said.

""But there certainly was an evolution. To me, that was most crystallized, around the time of underwear bomber,"" he said, referring to the Christmas Day 2009 plot to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner. ""That so changed the president's perception of how detail oriented he had to be on these things.""

From then on, he said, any terrorism threat the president was briefed about also had to include an operational briefing about what was being done to address it.

Still, it's a difficult balancing act for the president and his briefing team. Rhodes said the president needs to be disciplined enough not to be distracted by the uncorroborated bits of information  or to attribute more credibility to information only because it's classified. ""Sometimes you are so focused on what is secret that you're not looking at what's right in front of your eyes,"" Rhodes said in an interview with USA TODAY before the election.

""Its worrisome to get into raw intelligence,"" he said. ""Because you may have some intercept that you think is great, but it could be some official in some country, it could be just their view, or what they hope happens. Or, sometimes they know that the (National Security Agency) is listening, and they want us to intercept that raw intelligence. That's where the job of ODNI is very hard.""

ODNI is the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, an office created by Congress in 2004 in a series of post-9/11 intelligence reforms. While the briefing is assembled by ODNI with input from the entire intelligence community, the CIA  by virtue of its historic role and experience in analysis  still has an outsized role in the process.

Obama has said he's conscientious about hearing from a broad array of experts. ""I've learned to be pretty good at listening carefully to people who know a lot more than I do about a topic,"" Obama said in the YouTube interview. ""And taking sure that any dissenting voices are in the same room at the same time.""

But while Obama says he listens to all voices, not all of those voices feel that they're being heard.

A 2014 report from the Intelligence Community Inspector General interviewed intelligence analysts across the government and found that ""broader community participation in the President's Daily Brief (PDB) remains a challenge.""

Rhodes said the president has increasingly asked for lower-level analysts who are experts in a political topic to brief him personally  a practice that has been going on at least since Jimmy Carter's presidency. ""Let's get the analysts who are living through these issues every day,"" Rhodes said. ""He likes that, so he's tried to do that more.""

The daily book often contains dissenting views, which Leiter said were ""often the most illuminating thing in a PDB article.""

And under Obama, non-urgent raw intelligence often gets shopped around the intelligence community for corroboration and analysis before making it to the president. And highly sensitive information gleaned from top-secret sources and methods is balanced with open-source intelligence  the kind of information that's available to anyone reading a newspaper.

'Rebalancing' the PDB

Presidents, of course, also send signals back to the intelligence community about their policy priorities  and that gets reflected in their briefings.

Richard Nixon's had a heavy emphasis on Vietnam and China. Ronald Reagan's was almost singularly obsessed with the Soviet Union. And for the last two presidents, the Middle East has dominated the PDB  to the extent that the White House has occasionally had to remind intelligence agencies that Obama wants a wider aperture.

""You could write the PDB every day and never talk about anything except the Middle East and Russia,"" Rhodes said. ""To the point where weve had to say, 'Hey, guys, we're rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific. Make sure that's represented in the PDB.' You almost have to reach out for that stuff, because it doesn't always naturally come up.""

Obama's PDB also increasingly includes information on economic, environmental and public health crises that could have an impact on national security. And they're not necessarily confined to foreign affairs. Last summer, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz confirmed that Obama had been briefed on the spread of the Zika virus in Florida as part of his daily intelligence briefing.

World's most exclusive newspaper

The President's Daily Briefing, also known as ""the book,"" is among the most secret documents the government keeps. For a time, even its very existence was thought to be classified.

It's just one of dozens of products regularly produced by the intelligence community. But because it gets the attention of the commander in chief, it has a sense of urgency and importance  and even mystique  that other top secret documents don't have.

""Today it is such a vital part of how the White House operates that one can hardly imagine the modern presidency without it,"" said CIA Director John Brennan as the agency declassified 2,500 briefings to Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson last year. ""The PDB is the most abundantly staffed, most deeply sourced daily information service in the world.""

It's been referred to as the world's most exclusive daily newspaper, written exclusively for the president of the United States.

But presidents can and do share the PDB with a small circle of advisers.

Kennedy never shared his with his vice president. Nixon deeply distrusted the CIA and often ignored the briefing, instead delegating it to national security adviser Henry Kissinger.

The younger Bush restricted the distribution to just six or seven people. In the Obama administration, the distribution list is thought to be as many as two dozen, including the secretary of State. In her book Hard Choices, Clinton called the hand-delivered report the ""first order of business"" after getting to the office each morning. Her schedules, released under the Freedom of Information Act, often allotted the first five minutes of every morning to reading the PDB.

The president could even share the briefing with members of his family. Trump and his family have denied reports that he's sought security clearances for his children and for son-in-law Jared Kushner, but the president is the ultimate authority on how classified information can be shared and with whom.

Trump has also raised eyebrows by appearing to question the CIA's integrity in the wake of reports that the spy agency had concluded that Russia deliberately interfered in the election to get Trump elected. ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,"" the Trump transition said in a statement to reporters last week.

That prompted the White House to defend the intelligence officers  and suggest that Trump would do well to listen to them.

""President Obamas experience over the last eight years has been that the men and women of the intelligence community in the United States are patriots,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. ""President Obama is certainly not the first president to have enjoyed the benefits of the experts in our intelligence community, and I'm confident the president-elect would benefit from that advice if he remains open to it.""

Trump taps New York financier Vincent Viola as Army secretary,"Kicking off a holiday week of meetings at his South Florida estate, President-elect Donald Trump began filling in his Pentagon staff Monday by nominating infantry veteran and New York financier Vincent Vinnie Viola as secretary of the Army.

Whether it is his distinguished military service or highly impressive track record in the world of business, Vinnie has proved throughout his life that he knows how to be a leader and deliver major results in the face of any challenge,"" Trump said in a statement.

Trump has pledged to increase the size of the nation's armed forces.

Viola, founder and chairman of Virtu Financial and owner of pro hockey's Florida Panthers, said in a statement that, if confirmed by the Senate, ""I will work tirelessly to provide our President with the land force he will need to accomplish any mission in support of his National Defense Strategy.""

His primary focus, Viola said, ""will be ensuring that Americas soldiers have the ways and means to fight and win across the full spectrum of conflict.""

Trump made the announcement the same day that members of the Electoral College cast their votes for president in state capitals across the country. While anti-Trump groups are urging electors to vote for someone else, electors are expected to ratify the New York businessman's victory in last month's election.

The president-elect is operating from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where he plans to stay through at least Christmas Day.

As secretary of the Army, Viola would work with retired general James Mattis, whom Trump has nominated to be secretary of Defense.

In its announcement, the Trump transition team said Viola is a West Point graduate and he ""will combine a deep background in national security affairs with an impressive track record of leading and managing high-performing teams within the military and the private sector.""",R

His confirmation hearings are scheduled for January 10 and 11 before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

""From his time as U.S. Attorney to his tenure as attorney general for the state of Alabama, Jeff Sessions successfully prosecuted drug and violent criminals, corrupt politicians and white collar offenders and his record shows an absolute commitment to equal justice under law by putting the people first  not powerful special interests,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network.

Related: Trump Taps Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for Attorney General Post

Now the battle lines are being drawn over his nomination.

Sessions has a controversial past on issues of race and immigration, including his failed confirmation of a federal judgeship 30 years ago largely because of racially insensitive remarks.

In the 1980s, Sessions was considered for a Ronald Reagan-appointed federal district judgeship in Alabama, but was blocked by the Senate after a black former deputy, Thomas Figures, accused him of making racially insensitive statements. Figures said that Sessions called him ""boy"" and had once warned him to be careful about what he said to ""white folks."" Sessions denied the remarks under oath at the time. In addition, U.S. Attorney E.T. Rolison and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ginny Grenade - two people Figures said were in the room at the time of the alleged remarks -- signed affidavits saying they did not hear Sessions call Figures ""boy."" Grenade signed the affidavit in 1986 and Rolison signed one on December 8 of 2016.

Figures, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Alabama, also testified that, during a 1981 murder investigation tied to the Ku Klux Klan, Sessions commented that he ""used to think they [the KKK] were OK"" until he found out some were ""pot smokers."" Sessions claimed he had been joking.

Now, progressives are pouncing.

The progressive group People for the American Way has drawn attention to missing information that Sessions failed to include in a vast questionnaire that he is required to fill out ahead of his confirmation hearings.

In a 10-page memo that outlines Sessions' omissions, PFAW notes that in response to questions about his public statements, Sessions listed 48 opinion articles that he wrote. But the group found 43 more. He also didn't include any of the 60 press releases from 2003 and 2004, including one on the Federal Marriage Amendment, according to the group. Nor did Sessions make mention of his failed nomination to be a federal judge from 20 years ago.

 1986: NBC Reports On Jeff Sessions' Confirmation Hearing 3:55
""Sessions' questionnaire is grossly incomplete  we've found hundreds of relevant missing documents in just a few days,"" said Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way. ""It's ridiculous to think that the Senate could possibly give thorough consideration to a nominee with this many holes in his questionnaire.""

In response, Sessions submitted two additional pages of information on Thursday, including the listing of his judicial nomination.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the incoming ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is urging Republicans to delay the confirmation hearing.

In a letter to the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Feinstein suggested that a delay of the hearings might be necessary for two reasons: Sessions' incomplete questionnaire and the reams of information that the committee must investigate in less than a month. She noted that Sessions has more than 30 years of public service and public statements that must be analyzed, and the 150,000 pages of information he handed over, while not a complete accounting, is too much to assess before January 10.

""Staff must have sufficient time to do the due diligence on any nominee for this vital position  and this due diligence will likely take longer than the review for recent, prior nominees who had less materials to analyze,"" Feinstein wrote.

Drew Courtney, communications director for PFAW, said: ""No matter who the nominee is, the confirmation process for an attorney general needs to be taken seriously; Given Donald Trump's dismissive attitude towards the Constitution, that's doubly true this year. Senator Grassley is doing the country a real disservice by trying to rush the process.""

But Sen. Grassley has indicated that he has no intention of postponing the hearings. ""It is no surprise that Senator Sessions' twenty years of service as our colleaguenot to mention his service in the Department of Justice and to the State of Alabamayielded an extensive record,"" Grassley wrote in a letter responding to Feinstein.

Severino defended Sessions in a statement. ""Senator Sessions has turned over more material than any nominee in history and is well known to the senators. Liberals are scrambling to delay because they don't want an attorney general who puts the American people and the rule of law ahead of political agendas,"" Severino said.

This first battle is likely a sign of more conflicts to come over Sessions' nomination as the hearings approach.",R
Trump Team Asks State Dept. To Name Those Working On Gender Equality,"President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has asked the State Department to list its workers who focus on gender equality and ending violence against women, in what's being seen as an echo of an earlier request for the Energy Department to list employees who work on climate change.

In a brief email that was sent Wednesday morning, the Trump team asked the State Department's bureaus and offices to list any programs or activities that ""promote gender equality, such as ending gender-based violence, promoting women's participation in economic and political spheres, entrepreneurship, etc.""

The email was acquired and published by The New York Times, which reports:

""Although the wording of the memo is neutral and does not hint at any policy change, it rattled State Department employees, even those at senior levels. Some officials said they feared that the incoming Trump administration was trying to determine what programs were focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, though the memo did not refer to them.""
The team also asked the department offices to ""note positions whose primary functions are to promote such issues"" and to highlight any funds for the current financial year that are ""already allocated to such programs and activities.""

Affirming the Times' characterization of the email's reception, The Los Angeles Times quotes a senior State Department official who said, ""People are freaked out.""

Update 9 a.m. ET Friday: Trump Team's Response

In a statement about the request, the Trump transition team says:

""President-elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected. To help fulfill this promise, the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality, ends gender-based violence, and promotes economic and political participationfinding ways to improve them, along with hundreds of other requests.""
Our original post continues:

The topic also came up at Thursday's daily State Department briefing  but NPR's Michele Kelemen says it seemed that spokesman John Kirby mainly sought to calm nerves about the request.

In a report for our Newscast unit, Michele quotes Kirby as saying, ""To the degree that there is interest in the way that we have approached pursuing gender equality and human rights around the world by the transition team, we will certainly provide them the context, the information that is appropriate for them to make their own decisions going forward.""

Kirby acknowledged that there could be ""anxiety"" at a time of transition, but he refused to go into details about the email or to verify the accuracy of the leaked documents.

Addressing his agency's approach to gender issues, Kirby told a reporter, ""Obviously, gender equality issues here at the Department of State are a priority. Secretary Kerry has made them a priority; Secretary Clinton before him made it a priority, and it remains one for us here.""

Kirby also suggested that the State Department might balk at naming its employees who have worked on those priorities, saying that in a hypothetical case, ""if there were issue-specific names requested, obviously that would be of concern to us and it would not be the kind of information that we would deem to be appropriate to be passed along.""

Shortly after the transition team's email became public, the Twitter account of the State Department's Political-Military Affairs bureau posted a note of support for the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, & Security  a program that was celebrated in a State Department tweet Wednesday, as the agency marked five years since the plan was introduced by President Obama.

In response to reports about the memo, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement saying in part:

""In light of previous requests made by the Trump transition team, today's report that the incoming administration is requesting all information related to State Department programs that promote gender equality is concerning and the transition team should clarify their intent.... Women and girls' equality is transformative for communities and economies, and the existing State Department programs have achieved great successes to advance education access for girls, protect women from trafficking, end child marriage, and combat gender-based violence.""
The Trump team's request, which set a deadline of Wednesday afternoon to produce the lists, comes one week after the Energy Department rebuffed a request from Trump's transition team to name employees working on climate change.

As NPR's Brakkton Booker has reported, the Trump team's 74-point questionnaire on climate change ""raised fears among civil rights lawyers specializing in federal worker whistleblower protections, who say the incoming administration is at a minimum trying to influence or limit the research.""

In refusing the Trump team's request, the Energy Department said many of its staff members were ""unsettled"" by the gesture, stating that while it would share any information that was already public, it would not produce a list of individual names.

Early last week, Trump said he is nominating Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department.",R
"Donald Trumps doctor: If something happens to him, then it happens to him","Donald Trump's campaign and its supporters spent a good portion of the 2016 campaign arguing that Hillary Clinton was secretly very ill and not up to the task of being president.

Trump's doctor, by contrast, isn't too worried about his patient dying in office  at least, not when it comes to the future of the country.

If something happens to him, then it happens to him, Harold Bornstein says. Its like all the rest of us, no? Thats why we have a vice president and a speaker of the House and a whole line of people. They can just keep dying.

That amazing quote comes courtesy of a new interview Bornstein did with STAT. And it's part of a veritable murderer's row of curmudgeonly quotes from and anecdotes about the .?.?. well .?.?. interesting physician.

A few other quotes from the interview:

About the lack of disclosure about Trump's health and his being the oldest president: There's nothing to share on a regular basis. And: Ronald Reagan had pre-senile dementia. I mean, seriously, did they share that one with you, or did Nancy just cover it up?
Before agreeing to the interview, Bornstein pleaded for the reporter to leave him alone. Please stop this nonsense!!! he said in an email.
On having second thoughts about the interview being published afterward: I happen to have known the Sulzbergers [the family that owns the New York Times] for 50 years. Im going to make sure you dont ever work again if you do this.
Trump isn't an old man the way my grandfather was an old man. But Hillary Clinton: Shes an old lady. Shes an old lady. Its funny, isnt it?
On his son volunteering to work for Trump's campaign: What a great experience, for an 18-year-old to go to Trump Tower in a presidential year, with this character, of all people.
Bornstein, in case you haven't noticed, is kind of like Trump, if Trump were less rich and an eccentric gastroenterologist. Witness this anecdote:

The back of his business cards are written in Italian, with the phrase dottore molto famoso, or very famous doctor, below his name. (For 10 years, he took private Italian lessons from women he found through Craigslist postings, paying them about $60 an hour for weekly sessions, he said.) A photograph of his psychoanalyst hangs in his office. As this reporter left his office, Bornstein pointed out what appeared to be a small, naked doll sitting on the ground  heres a naked doorstop.

Bornstein says he isn't sure whether he'll continue as Trump's physician while Trump serves as president. As a media professional, I think I speak for all of us when I say we'd prefer that he did.",R
Newt Gingrich says Trump is done with drain the swamp,"There were two notable Trumpworld headlines Wednesday morning. One was the news that Corey Lewandowski  Donald Trump's former campaign manager who remained part of his inner circle long after leaving that job  had just opened a full service government relations and consulting firm half a block from the White House.

The other was that the president-elect is apparently over drain the swamp.

That's according to Newt Gingrich, a top ally who told NPR in an interview that aired Wednesday morning that he was instructed not to use the phrase anymore because it has fallen out of favor with Trump.

I'm told he now just disclaims that, Gingrich said on Morning Edition. He now says it was cute, but he doesn't want to use it anymore.

Gingrich said he had written what I thought was a very cute tweet about 'the alligators are complaining,'"" but that somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.

Gingrich actually drafted two tweets in recent days about draining the swamp  tweets that apparently earned him the rebuke.


But this should really come as no surprise. Trump himself has acknowledged his on-again, off-again relationship with the phrase. And it actually wasn't a mainstay in the campaign until the final days.

Trump freely admitted that he never much liked the phrase, in fact. But he said that his crowds had prevailed upon him to embrace it.

""'Drain the swamp.' We put it in about two days ago. I said, 'Drain the swamp.' I didn't like it. I didn't like the expression: 'Drain the swamp in Washington,'"" Trump said Oct. 26 at a rally in North Carolina. So I said it three days ago; the place went crazy. I said, 'You know what? I'm starting to like that expression.' And now it's a hot  it's like trending all over the world.

Trump explains why he didnt like the phrase drain the swamp but now does  Play Video0:39
At a rally in Kinston, N.C., Oct. 26, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump said the phrase drain the swamp had been trending all over the world since he started using it. (The Washington Post)
As admissions of political expediency go, this is pretty forthcoming.

But it's also worth noting here that Trump's flip on this phrase seems to have come pretty suddenly. Just a day before Gingrich's first tweet above, Trump promised in Alabama to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. He said the same in Orlando the day before and in Hershey, Pa., the day before that.

So it's not clear whether a specific story or cable news item  which have a tendency to draw instant Trump policy directives and declarations  might have influenced this change of course, if indeed it sticks. But what's clear is that Trump's efforts to drain the swamp have increasingly been derided and scoffed at as he has named a Goldman Sachs executive to head the Treasury Department and politicians and fellow billionaires to lead other departments. And then there are the many possible conflicts of interest.

Saturday Night Live a couple weeks back featured this well-written exchange:

KATE MCKINNON-AS-KELLYANNE CONWAY: Don't you mean drain the swamp and build the wall?

BALDWIN-AS-TRUMP: No, that's too many things. Just smush them together.

The sketch earned an immediate rebuke from Trump. It's not clear whether he objected to this particular passage  his visage was compared in the sketch to a plate of mashed potatoes, after all  but you can bet Trump has noticed the derisive coverage of his pledge to drain the swamp.

Just as it was an attractive mantra on the campaign trail, it's become an easily accessible counterpoint to Trump's ongoing struggles with his business empire, conflicts of interest and Cabinet picks that don't really jibe with his promise to shake up Washington.

And given that he never really liked the phrase, it should be no surprise he might be willing to drop it like a bad habit.",R
Trump picks budget 'hawk' Mick Mulvaney to lead budget office,"President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Mick Mulvaney, a conservative Republican congressman from South Carolina who is known as a budget hawk, as director of the Office of Management and Budget.

In a statement issued on Saturday morning  shortly after Trump tweeted an inflammatory comment about Chinas seizure of a US navy drone in the South China Sea  Trump called Mulvaney a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nations finances and save our country from drowning in red ink.

Trump also said that with Mulvaney as his budget director, his administration would make smart choices and renew the American taxpayers trust in how their money is spent.

Mulvaney said he would help restore budgetary and fiscal sanity  after eight years of an out-of-control, tax-and-spend financial agenda under Barack Obama.

Like other Trump nominations, the budget directors job requires Senate approval.

Mulvaneys nomination follows a pattern of Trump turning to individuals with records apparently hostile to the agencies they are nominated to lead.

For example, the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, a leading critic of climate change theories, has been nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

In other such moves, the billionaire and charter schools advocate Betsy DeVos has been nominated as education secretary and the Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, a critic of voting rights legislation, has been nominated as attorney general.

The announcement about Mulvaney was made as Trump, who takes office on 20 January, began his holiday vacation at Mar-a-Lago, his oceanfront club in Palm Beach, Florida.

Mulvaney, 49, was an outspoken critic of the former House speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. 

His selection points to a strategy by Trump to cut government where he can. The president-elect has recently railed against what he has called a far too expensive new version of the Air Force One aircraft he will use, which Boeing is supposed to build.

With Mick at the head of OMB, Trump said in his statement, my administration is going to make smart choices about Americas budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayers trust in how their money is spent.

Mulvaney said: Each day, families across our nation make disciplined choices about how to spend their hard-earned money, and the federal government should exercise the same discretion that hard-working Americans do every day, he said.

On Friday night, Trump vowed to seek approval from Congress for $1tn in new spending to rebuild the countrys crumbling network of roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure as a way to create jobs and make some needed repairs.

We are going to fix our country. Its time. We have no choice. Its time, Trump said at a rally in Orlando, Florida.",R
"Hillary Clinton Thanks Supporters, Refers to Popular Vote Win in End-of-Year Email","Hillary Clinton thanked her supporters, referring to her popular-vote victory, and wished them a happy holiday season in an end-of-year email sent Monday.

In the email, Clinton mentioned the rough number of votes she received in the 2016 presidential election and that her popular vote win showed promise.

""Before this year ends, I want to thank you again for your support of our campaign,"" Clinton wrote in the email. ""While we didn't achieve the outcome we sought, I'm proud of the vision and values we fought for and the nearly 66 million people who voted for them.""

Clinton also encouraged supporters to keep pressing forward saying she believes it is ""our responsibility to keep doing our part to build a better, stronger, and fairer future for our country and the world.""

But she did not indicate any specific plans for the future.

Putin Shrugs Off Trump's Tweet On Expanding U.S. Nuclear Capability,"Russian President Vladimir Putin downplayed Donald Trump's tweet Thursday calling for the United States to expand its nuclear capabilities.

""There's nothing out of the ordinary here,"" Putin said, since the U.S. president-elect had advocated a stronger military throughout his election campaign.

The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016
Putin took a deep dive into U.S. politics on Friday during his annual news conference in Moscow, praising Trump and skewering President Obama and Hillary Clinton. During a marathon Q&A session that lasted almost four hours, reporters kept returning to the accusations of Kremlin interference in the U.S. presidential election. Putin took them on with gusto, at times sounding like a Trump surrogate.

""The current administration and the Democratic Party leadership are trying to blame all their failures on external factors,"" Putin said.

The Russian president said he agreed with Trump that anybody  even someone lying on their sofa  could have hacked the Democratic National Committee. The most important thing, according to Putin, is the information that came out of the hack, namely the machinations among top Democrats.

America's ""ruling party,"" he said, has clearly forgotten the original meaning of the word ""democratic.""

The fact that a growing number of Republicans has a favorable view of Putin shows that a ""significant portion"" of Americans shares the concerns and ""traditional values"" of Russians, Putin said, adding that mutual sympathy could be the basis for closer relations in the future.

He took issue with Obama's assertion last week that late Republican President Ronald Reagan ""would roll over in his grave"" because of Putin's popularity in the GOP. On the contrary, Putin said, Reagan would be happy that Republicans are winning everywhere and had Trump, who understood the mood of the people.

""He went all the way, even though only we believed that he would win,"" Putin said to laughter and applause.

On Friday, Trump said in a statement that he received ""a very nice letter"" from Putin, adding that ""his thoughts are so correct.""

In an indication that he's through with Obama, Putin said it's more likely that great Democrats are turning over in their graves. Unlike President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who united Americans, the outgoing administration divided them, Putin said.

Even as he insisted on Russia's inability to sway the U.S. elections, Putin didn't hesitate to criticize the ""archaic nature"" of the Electoral College.

What he didn't mention is that Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.",R
Split decision: Americans assess Obama's legacy,"WASHINGTON  Americans in a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll rate the Affordable Care Act as President Obama's greatest achievement in the White House. Also, as his biggest failure.

In yet another sign of how polarized the United States remains, the signature initiative known as Obamacare draws the strongest praise from his supporters and the sharpest rebuke from his critics as Americans begin to consider how history will judge the nation's 44th president.

On one thing there is agreement across partisan lines: Six in 10 predict incoming president Donald Trump will significantly dismantle Obama's legacy. Three-fourths of Democrats call that a bad thing; three-fourths of Republicans call it a good one.

""The impression he pushed was that he wanted to undo everything on Day One, somehow, miraculously,"" says Megan Glidewell, 37, a college counselor from Waconia, Minn., who voted for Hillary Clinton. She was among those called in the poll. ""I know that's not how it works, but it certainly felt like what he wanted and what the people who voted for him wanted.""

About a third of those surveyed say Obama ultimately will be seen as a ""good"" president; 18% say he'll be a ""great"" one. But one in four say history will rate him as only ""fair,"" and another one in four say he'll be seen as a ""failed"" president.

President Obama's final weeks in office
The split by party is predictably stark: 86% of Democrats say Obama will be judged to have been a good or great president; 83% of Republicans say he will be seen as a fair or failed one.

""There was a lot of hope but a lot of under-delivery with him,"" says David Ockrim, 30, who operates a Yankee Doodle Dandy food truck in New York City.

""A total failure,"" scoffs Stephen Spence, 69, of Mesa, Ariz. ""On the economy, on immigration, on helping people from other countries that are fighting ISIS.""

""I think history would judge him well, but it's probably going to take a while,"" says Queen Jones, 73, a retired teacher's assistant from Mount Pleasant, N.C. ""I think he'll be judged well because of what he inherited when he came in and where the economy is right now.""

The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Wednesday through Sunday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Trump is within his rights to use executive power, Obama says
Overall, Obama is leaving office with healthy ratings. By 55%-40%, Americans have a favorable opinion of him. That's much better than Trump's ratings, which remain underwater by 5 points  41% favorable, 46% unfavorable  although the president-elect's standing has been improving. Just before Election Day, in late October, Trump was at 31% favorable, 61% unfavorable in the USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll.

Fifty-four percent now approve of the job Obama is doing as president.

When it comes to ranking his greatest achievements as president, close to one in four cite the Affordable Care Act. Nearly as many, 22%, name the economy's recovery after the Great Recession.

""If you look at the long-term history of the country, George W. Bush left him, frankly, with a pile of"" trouble, says Kathleen Hoynes, 56, of Upper Gwynedd, north of Philadelphia, using an expletive and crediting Obama with rescuing the economy. That said, she went on, ""I did not agree with a lot of what he did in not getting out of war and on race relations. He didn't do enough.""

Indeed, dealing with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ranks second on the list of Obama's failures, and handling race relations is third. It was cited by 15% of whites and 13% of blacks. As the nation's only African-American president, expectations were high that his election represented a breakthrough in race relations.

The Affordable Care Act was cited by 27% on the list of his biggest failures, nearly twice as many as any other issue.",R
"Feds: Pension Exec Moved $2B for Coke, Hookers, Other Bribes","A former top official at the country's third-largest pension fund and two broker-dealers were charged Wednesday in what a federal prosecutor described as a classic bribery scheme that steered $2 billion in trades in exchange for drugs, prostitutes, vacations and U.S. Open tennis tickets.

""The hard-earned pension savings of New Yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt, personal enrichment,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement, calling the alleged pay-for-play arrangement a ""classic, quid-pro-quo bribery scheme.""

Navnoor Kang, the ex-head of the $184 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund's fixed income trades, received more than $100,000 worth of bribes in the form of trips, gifts, luxury hotel stays and other payoffs from broker-dealers Deborah Kelley and Gregg Schonhorn, prosecutors said.

Kang, 38, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, on securities fraud, honest service wire fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges.

His attorney, Lauren DeSantis-Then, said her client denies all the charges.

""Mr. Kang is not guilty and we look forward to our day in court,"" she said.

Kelley, 58, of Piedmont, California, was expected to surrender, authorities said. Her attorney didn't immediately return a request for comment.

Schonhorn, 45, of Short Hills, New Jersey, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal authorities, court papers show. His lawyer didn't immediately return a request for comment.

Regulators found that Kang steered about $2 billion in fixed-income trades to firms represented by Kelley and Schonhorn beginning in early 2014, resulting in millions of dollars in commissions, of which the two earned between 35 and 40 percent, according to an indictment.

In that time, securities investigators found that the firms' fixed-income business surged, with one of them increasing its domestic bond transactions from zero at the end of fiscal year 2013 to $2.378 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016, making it one of the top broker dealers doing state pension fund business, according to the complaint.

Prosecutors said that in exchange, Kang received a $10,000 all-expenses-paid trip to Montreal, Canada; a ski trip to Park City, Utah; tickets to a Paul McCartney concert in New Orleans; a $17,420 Panerai wristwatch; dinners at upscale restaurants; nights out at strip clubs; prostitutes; and cocaine.

The state's pension fund has been the source of scandal before.

In 2010, a state comptroller pleaded guilty to charges he steered pension funds to a campaign contributor. Further investigations revealed investors' widespread use of so-called placement agents to access pension funds, an arrangement some regulators have likened to pay-to-play.

Kang had been fired in 2012 by a private investment firm for accepting gifts from Schonhorn in exchange for steering fixed-income business, but he lied about his termination when he was hired by the state fund, according to the complaint.

Asked whether state officials properly investigated Kang before hiring him, a spokesman for the comptroller's office said only that ""background checks are a routine part of the hiring process.""",R
Intelligence Agencies Distressed by Trump's Rejection of Findings on Russia,"President-elect Donald Trump's dismissal of U.S. intelligence findings that Russia tried to sway the presidential election is a distressing slap in the face to the intelligence community, current and former U.S. intelligence officials said Sunday.

Trump on Sunday repeated his rejection of the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia actively worked to help him win the election, calling the idea ""ridiculous"" in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""

The comment, like others that Trump made during the campaign, ""is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country,"" a U.S. intelligence official told NBC News.

Goldman executive Gary Cohn tapped for White House economic post  report,"President-elect Donald Trump has asked Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn to head his White House national economic council, a group that coordinates economic policy across agencies, NBC News reported on Friday.

If elected, Cohn would be the third Goldman alumni picked to serve in the Trump administration: Steven Mnuchin, nominated to head the treasury department, and Steve Bannon, picked to be White House chief strategist, are both ex-Goldman Sachs executives.

Cohn, 56, is president and chief operating officer at the Wall Street firm and had until recently been widely considered the heir apparent to chief executive Lloyd Blankfein. But according to the Wall Street Journal, Cohn, who met with Trump on Tuesday, has been considering a move in recent months.

Opponents warn the administration is set to be packed with tycoons who will do nothing to fulfil his promise of helping working-class Americans
 
A Goldman Sachs spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

Cohn is a former Goldman commodities trader from Ohio who joined the firm in 1990. He served in a variety of leadership roles in bond trading, becoming co-head of Goldmans broader securities and, eventually, co-president in 2006. He makes frequent appearances at industry conferences and on television, speaking on the state of the financial markets.

Cohn is a registered Democrat who has donated money to both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

If he takes the post, he will be following in the footsteps of Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman, two other onetime Goldman Sachs executives who served in that role.

Trump protesters plan to open 'movement house' in Washington DC,"A group of millennial activists from across the country plan to open a movement house in Washington DC next month, which will serve as a permanent base to protest Donald Trumps presidency.

The organizers are mostly women of color, many of whom campaigned for Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary.

The house, which will be set up by inauguration day on 20 January, has been dubbed District 13, in a reference to a rebellious neighborhood in the Hunger Games books and films.

Activists told the Guardian that it will serve as a space for the best kinds of troublemakers from around the country. The property will be located in Capitol Hill, close to the White House and the Capitol building, and will enable activists to quickly mobilize against Trump should he court controversy during his presidency.


Ripples of a revolution: what will Bernie Sanders' supporters do next?

Ultimately its to make sure we hold him accountable, said Moumita Ahmed, the founder of Millennials for Revolution, a group which span off from the Bernie Sanders-supporting Millennials for Bernie.

Because his presidency is not normal at all. Its our duty to make sure he doesnt succeed.

If he succeeds its a message that everything he stood for is OK. That its OK to get to power in the way that he did, and hurt all the people hes hurt.

District 13 will be open to activist groups around the country who wish to demonstrate in the capital, Ahmed said. The house is inspired by movement houses from the civil rights era, which served as a safe haven for people to plan marches and protests.

People from ethnic-minority activist groups, such as African Americans for Bernie and Color of Change, are involved in planning for the movement house, while climate change and minimum wage campaigners have also contributed.

Most of the people involved are people who will most definitely be affected by this administration, Ahmed said.

As someone who is from a Muslim family, Im invested in the safety of my community. And I see this administration as a threat to my community, especially because of the rhetoric that was used to become the president.

The groups launched a crowdfunding effort on Tuesday to support District 13. They aim to reach $50,000, which will cover the houses rent for one year.

Erika Peralta, who has worked for Color of Change  an organization with more than one million members that works to create a more human and less hostile world for black people in America  is another organizer of District 13. She plans to live in the house for the first three months of Trumps presidency.

The aim is to be a focal point and a nexus for activists and progressive people across the country to provide them resources and aid and our networks to stop any hatred that may come from the White House or to stand up against it, Peralta said.

Were going to work to make sure that whatever [Trump] is trying to do, whether its a Muslim registry or deport a bunch of immigrants, were not going to let that happen.",R
Democrats Hope Trump's Cabinet Picks Will Stand in Their Own Way,"With Democrats unable to stop President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks on their own, they're hoping that increased scrutiny on his nominees will do it for them.

As the minority party in the Senate with little real recourse at their disposal, uncovering something disqualifying may be Democrats' last best hope to block some Trump selections that they view as unacceptable and outside the political mainstream.

Even if they don't have the votes to shoot down any nominees, Democratic senators will grill them in committee hearings. They can slow the confirmation process with procedural moves or try to shame them  all in the service of trying to peel off the three Republican votes they would need to kill a nomination or force the Trump White House to withdraw the pick.

Not all of Trump's picks will face such aggressive scrutiny, which Democrats insist is not merely reflexive partisan opposition. Retired Gen. James Mattis is expected to sail through his confirmation to be defense secretary, even though his recent tenure in the active-duty military means he'll need a special waiver that requires 60 votes in the Senate.

But some of Trump's picks, Democrats say, represent existential threats to the basic mission of the departments they've been tapped to lead, and so the nominees have no business in those jobs.

There's Trump's reported pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, chief executive of oil giant ExxonMobil, who has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. There's Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has made a name for himself by suing the agency. There's Andy Puzder, Trump's choice for the Labor Department, a fast food executive who wants to replace workers with robots.

There's Betsy DeVos, a school choice advocate seen as hostile to public education, whom Trump wants to put in charge of the Education Department. And there's attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, an anti-immigration hard-liner whom the Senate once rejected for a federal judgeship over past racially insensitive comments.


Democratic congressional aides and outside groups will spend the coming weeks poring over the financial statements, personal histories and public utterances of Trump's most polarizing Cabinet selections, hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird  Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees who were forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation process.

And Democrats have reason to believe Trump's nominees provide an especially rich vein for digging, because according to reports, few have been subjected to a traditionally thorough vetting process by his transition team. Many are wealthy business executives with sprawling financial entanglements and no political experience or the scrutiny that comes with it.

""What's unusual about Trump's Cabinet picks is that so few of them come from politics, which means that they're going to have a harder time than usual going through the traditional vet and public evaluation,"" said Simon Rosenberg, president of the Democratic think tank NDN. ""Some of them are going to crash. Some of them aren't going to make it because of things that are going to come up in their background.""

Democrats will have to pick their battles, and priorities will likely be decided based not only by how threatening they find Trump's nominees, but how vulnerable the nominees are after some digging.

""Much of it depends on what's uncovered in the vetting process,"" said Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""As Senator Daschle found out, one little thing can trip you up.""

Daschle was nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services in 2009 but removed his name after controversy over his taxes emerged.

Old domestic abuse allegations related to a messy divorce have already surfaced with Puzder. But complicated financial issues are more likely to trip up Trump's nominees than personal indiscretions, especially given the number of super-wealthy candidates Trump has chosen.

""The Senate Finance Committee has developed a reputation as somewhat of a killing field for nominees in recent years,"" Manley said. ""They've developed the experience to really pick apart the financials.""

And Trump's team may be flying blind to some extent. His transition team has reportedly forgone the rigorous vetting process traditionally performed on potential nominees before they are announced publicly, leaving his picks potentially vulnerable to surprises.

Selecting Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-kansas, as CIA director was ""pretty simple,"" said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, who is working on Trump's transition team.

""They asked me who would be the person for the agency, and I said without a doubt that Pompeo would be a great pick,"" Nunes told Politico.

Dan Kanninen, a former Obama White House official who helped choose candidates for jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency, said it takes weeks or months for even the best transition teams to properly vet candidates.

""With Trump, none of that, as far as we can tell, happened before the election. And now, if it is happening at all, it's happening in a matter of days based on the gut on the president-elect,"" he said. ""It would not surprise me at all, given how little we know  and frankly how little the Trump team knows  if something came up with of a magnitude that might kill some of their nominations.""

Even under the best of circumstances, things get missed. Clinton rescinded Baird's nomination to be attorney general because it was discovered that she had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny.

The Senate confirmation process can be brutal even for squeaky clean candidates who have spent their whole careers in government. A ""Survivor's Guide for Presidential Nominees"" prepared by the National Academy of Public Administration, a congressionally chartered non-profit, stretches over 71 pages and warns, ""If you are not nervous going into your confirmation hearing, you should be.""

 Nov. 24: Trump Scrutinized Over Cabinet Picks, Intelligence Briefings 2:38
It may be especially bumpy for Trump's nominees from the private sector, who are not accustomed to government processes and who have not already gone through the kind of public and legal scrutiny politicians and government officials are used to.

Three years ago, facing Republican obstruction, Senate Democrats decided to kill the filibuster for executive branch appointments, which means they now cannot force Republicans to find the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. Republicans need only 51 votes in the Senate to confirm Trump's Cabinet picks.

Democrats would need three Republicans to join them to shoot down any of Trump's nominees, and so far none have expressed interest in taking up the cause.

Some Democrats, unsurprisingly, are having buyer's remorse about the filibuster change, including Reid's successor as Democratic Leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York.

""I wanted 60 for Supreme Court and Cabinet, but I didn't prevail,"" Schumer told The Washington Post.

Still, he vowed opposition to some nominees, however possible. ""If it's somebody who is out of the mainstream,"" Schumer said, ""we'll fight tooth and nail and use every tool we have.""

The Senate has traditionally deferred to new presidents' wishes in filling out their Cabinets, approving many nominees without bothering to even take formal votes.

Recent incoming presidents have had to withdraw only one or two Cabinet picks, if any at all, and the Senate has voted to outright reject just three nominees in the past 100 years, according to the Senate historian.

But Democrats are in no mood to be deferential to Trump after Republicans, in their view, broke with tradition by obstructing Obama Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland for nine months and fought the confirmation of his second attorney general, Loretta Lynch.

And they say Trump has chosen blatantly provocative or unqualified nominees, instead of trying to find common ground in a divided country.

""Donald Trump is kind of giving a big middle finger to that entire department by nominating someone who was found to have 50 percent of his restaurants in noncompliance with labor laws,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, told MSNBC on Friday of Trump's decision to name Puzder to head the department responsible for protecting workers. ",R
"Before Trump's Presidency, US Privacy Board in Disarray","A federal board responsible for protecting Americans against abuses by spy agencies is in disarray just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.

The five-member Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will have only two remaining members as of Jan. 7  and no Democrats even though it is required to operate as an independent, bipartisan agency.

The vacancies mean it will lack the minimum three members required to conduct business and can work only on ongoing projects. Trump would have to nominate new members, who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.

The board was revitalized after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's disclosures on the scope of U.S. spying in 2013. It notably concluded that the NSA's phone surveillance program was unconstitutional.",R
Rex Tillerson: an appointment that would confirm Putin's US election win,"If Rex Tillerson is nominated as the next secretary of state, it would confirm Vladimir Putin as one of the strategic victors of the US presidential election.

Barack Obama has ordered an inquiry into covert Russian intervention in the campaign, which the CIA says was designed to secure a victory for Donald Trump. But whether or not Russian intervention made a significant difference to the outcome, a Tillerson appointment would represent a significant gain for Moscow.

While the other leading candidates for the job hold largely traditional and adversarial views on Russia, the outgoing chief executive of Exxon Mobil has a history of close business ties to Putin, who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2013.

The Wall Street Journal reported: Friends and associates said few US citizens are closer to Mr Putin than Mr Tillerson.

The 64-year-old Texas oilman spent much of his career working on Russian deals, including a 2011 agreement giving Exxon Mobil access to the huge resources under the Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant state-owned Russian oil company, OAO Rosneft, the opportunity to invest in Exxon Mobils operations overseas.

Tillerson is also friends with the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a former interpreter who worked as chief of staff for Putin when he was deputy mayor in St Petersburg in the mid-1990s. Sechin, sometimes described as the second-most-powerful man in Russia, is now under US sanctions. He has said that one of his ambitions is to ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson.

The 2011 Exxon-Rosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Exxon Mobil estimated the sanctions cost it $1bn and Tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be lifted.

Trumps choice suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it
Thomas Wright, Brookings Institution
We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions, he said, at a shareholders meeting.

In June, two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin, Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summit.

If the sanctions were lifted, the Arctic project would probably go ahead and Tillersons retirement fund of Exxon Mobil stock would increase in value. He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department. It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career.

Trumps choice of Rex Tillerson suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it, said Thomas Wright, who has written extensively on Trumps foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.


Tillerson has a relationship with Putin and he opposed the sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea. This will alarm those worried about Russian intentions in Europe.

Praising Tillerson in an interview with Fox News Sunday, Trump said: To me a great advantage is that he knows many of the players in the world and he knows them well.

Lest there be any doubt about which players the president-elect had in mind, Trump added: He does massive deals in Russia not for himself, but for the company.

A culture of intimidation

In a very real sense, Tillerson has been a head of a state within a state. Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries. It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forces.

As a state, it has much in common with the one run by Putin and Sechin.

Reporting on Exxon was not only harder than reporting on the Bin Ladens, it was harder than reporting on the CIA by an order of magnitude, said Steve Coll, who wrote about the company in a book, Private Empire.

They have a culture of intimidation that they bring to bear in their external relations, and it is plenty understood inside the corporation too. They make people nervous, they make people afraid, Coll, now a journalism professor at Columbia University, told Texas Monthly.

Running the state department would not be like running Exxon Mobil, however. For a start, Tillerson would have to audition in front of a sceptical Senate. On Saturday, leading Democrats were painting him as a Moscow stooge.

The New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said on Twitter: Rex Tillerson as secretary of state would guarantee Russia has a willing accomplice in the presidents cabinet.

With a slim 52-48 majority, it would only take three Republican senators in revolt to cast Tillersons job in doubt. He would face aggressive questioning from Republican foreign policy hawks, led by John McCain.

I have obviously concerns about his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a murderer, but obviously we will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined and then its the time to make up your mind on whether to vote yes or no, the Arizona senator told CNN on Saturday.

A US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values would be a disaster for Russia
Andrei Kozyrev, former Russian foreign minister
McCains former chief of staff, Mark Salter, was far more blunt on Twitter. Tillerson would sell out Nato for Sakhalin oil and his pal, Vlad, he wrote. Should be a rough confirmation hearing, and a no vote on the Senate floor.

Even if Tillerson were to be confirmed, he would not take over the state department with a free hand to rewrite policy. He would face a striking culture clash with the institution, the bastion of foreign policy orthodoxy, which would have an ally in the secretary of defence nominee, retired general James Mattis, who is likely to oppose any erosion of Nato solidarity in the face of Moscows assertiveness in Europe.

Nevertheless, Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Endowment Moscow Center, argued: Tillerson as secretary of state would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the cold war.

Not just in US-Russian relations: a Trump-Tillerson foreign policy would be squarely focused on US national interests, rather than on its global pretensions or any ideology.

Trenin added: It would be hard-nosed and no-nonsense, not averse to the use of force, but in response to a real rather than imaginary threat. In one word: realist.

That is a change that would be undoubtedly be welcomed by Putin, whose vision of foreign policy centres on spheres of interest controlled by global powers, run by strongmen like himself.

Andrei Kozyrev, a former Russian foreign minister, argued that the Kremlin should be careful what it wishes for.

The paradoxical situation now is that Russia is hoping for a US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values, but that would be a disaster for Russia, said Kozyrev, who is now at the Wilson Center thinktank in Washington.

Why? Because the only interest America has in ending the conflicts in eastern Ukraine  or in Syria is actually in American values  that America should be concerned and do everything to alleviate the humanitarian situation and they should help nations to find their path to democracy.

The realpolitik situation is that Russia is stuck in both military conflicts. If you look at this with a cold eye, you say: Let them go on and let them enjoy the disaster they have in eastern Ukraine, Kozyrev said.

Look at Syria. By realpolitik the Americans would rather sit and wait while Russia draws on its resources and gets into bloody conflict.",R
"Donald Trump: It's Bill Clinton Who 'Doesn't Know Much'
","A war of words between Donald Trump and Bill Clinton escalated after the former president told a local newspaper that Trump ""doesn't know much"" and blamed his wife's loss in the race for the White House on FBI Director James Comey and Russian hackers.

The president-elect took to his Twitter feed to respond Tuesday morning.

Clinton made the initial remarks last week to a group of people he ran into at a small bookstore in Westchester County, NY, including an editor at the Bedford-Pound Ridge Record Review, who published Clinton's comments.

 Trump under pressure to acknowledge Russian hacking 7:23
""James Comey cost her the election,"" Clinton reportedly said, referring to Comey sending a letter to lawmakers just two weeks before the election about the finding of new emails the FBI said could be pertinent to an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server during her time as secretary of state. Clinton added, ""We were seven (percentage) points up"" in the polls and slated to win before Comey's announcement.

Two days before the election, Comey told members of Congress that the FBI found nothing new in the e-mails but Clinton maintained the damage had already been done.

In the reports of Clinton's stop at the bookstore, Clinton was characterized has having had taken a call from Trump after the election and described it as ""cordial."" On Tuesday afternoon, Clinton sought to clear up who initiated the phone call through his own Twitter feed:

Clinton was also asked at the book store if he thought Trump was a smart man. ""He doesn't know much. One thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him,"" Clinton reportedly responded. He had previously said he believed Russia was also to blame for releasing internal Democratic emails and documents that hurt his wife's election's prospects before Election Day.

""I've watched her battle through that bogus email deal and be vindicated at the end,"" Clinton said earlier this week. ""She fought through everything, and she prevailed against it all. But, you know, with the end we had the Russians and the FBI deal, which she couldn't prevail against that.""",R
Trump again claims he 'would have won' popular vote,"In his latest Twitter tirade, President-elect Donald Trump has once again claimed he could have won more votes than his rival Hillary Clinton.
""I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently,"" he said.
The Republican insisted his strategy was more ""sophisticated"".
He won nearly three million fewer votes than the Democratic candidate, but prevailed in the electoral college.
The arcane but all-important institution formally certified him earlier this week as winner of the 2016 presidential election.
But the Manhattan billionaire is apparently still chafing at critics' claims that he lacks a popular mandate.
What exactly is the electoral college?
In two other tweets on Wednesday morning, Mr Trump said: ""Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!""

The businessman - who is spending the festive season at his resort in Florida - added: ""I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!""
But Mr Trump appears to have conceded finally that he lost the popular vote.
Late last month he erroneously claimed in a tweet that ""in addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally"".
He later tweeted that there was ""serious voter fraud"" in Virginia, New Hampshire, and California.
No such electoral illegality has been adduced by US election officials or observers.

Newly certified Trump feuds with Bill Clinton,"Now that the Electoral College has officially made him president-elect, Donald Trump spent Tuesday holding meetings and feuding with former president Bill Clinton.

Responding to criticism from the ex-president, Trump said he and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lost this year's election because they failed to pay attention to essential states.

""They focused on wrong states,"" Trump said in a brief tweet burst.

In an interview with a weekly newspaper in New York state, Clinton said that Trump ""doesn't know much,"" but ""one thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him."" Clinton also said that Trump called him after the election, another source of dispute between the two men.

Tweeted Trump: ""Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations).""

The president-elect said Clinton is the one who ""doesn't know much,"" including ""how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more).""

Bill Clinton: Hillary 'couldn't prevail' over Russians, FBI
While losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by more than 2.8 million, Trump triumphed in the Electoral College by winning more states. They included industrial states that had gone Democratic in recent presidential elections: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

Electors in those and other states ratified Trump's victory in Monday meetings of the Electoral College.

Despite the efforts of anti-Trump organizations, only two electors defected from the Republican candidate; five Democratic electors refused to vote for Clinton.

""With this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead,"" the president-elect said after the Electoral College vote. ""I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans. Together, we will make America great again.

The president-elect is spending Christmas week at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where he is holding job interviews and planning meetings.

Trump will be sworn in as the nation's 45th president a month from Tuesday.

Trump also issued statements condemning deadly attacks in Germany and Turkey.

After a truck attack on a holiday market in Berlin, Trump said ""innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday ... These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.""

Trump also spoke out after Russia's ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was ""assassinated by a radical Islamic terrorist.""

He added: ""The murder of an ambassador is a violation of all rules of civilized order and must be universally condemned.",R
Will Trump's plan mean faster rate hikes?,"The Federal Reserve is virtually certain to raise interest rates this week for the first time this year, but the course of future hikes has suddenly become cloudier.

The Fed has signaled for many weeks that it plans to hoist its key rate by a quarter percentage point at a two-day meeting that begins Tuesday, and futures markets say theres a 93% chance it will follow through.

Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trumps fiscal stimulus proposals may ultimately require faster rate increases to head off inflation, while other byproducts of his plan could slow the economy and prompt the Fed to act more cautiously.

For now, economists dont expect Fed policymakers to weigh such hypotheticals as they draft their quarterly projections for rate increases over the next few years. Even so, with unemployment falling rapidly and inflation finally picking up, Fed officials likely are no longer inclined to call for slower rate hikes over the long-term, as they have in each of their previous forecasts this year amid headwinds such as weak productivity growth, economists say.


Unemployment is falling toward levels that are arguably below stable inflation, says Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economics professor and author of the Fedwatch blog.  Yet he says the Fed will almost certainly reiterate that rate increases will be gradual.

In November, the jobless rate dropped to 4.6% from 4.9% the previous month. Thats already below the 4.8% that the Fed has deemed the lowest average rate sustainable without generating excessive inflation, or rapid price increases that decrease consumers' purchasing power and especially hurt savers and those on fixed incomes. Low unemployment typically pushes up wages as employers compete for fewer available workers, and price increases typically follow as the firms scramble to maintain profit margins.

That doesnt mean persistently low inflation is poised to suddenly spike.While an inflation measure closely monitored by the Fed rose from 1.2% to 1.4% annually in October as the effects of low gasoline prices faded, thats well below the Feds 2% target.

Still, it was the fastest pace in two years. And annual wage growth hit a seven-year high in October and has climbed steadily since early 2015 in a further signal that inflation is firming, Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients.

In September, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that discouraged workers on the sidelines were streaming back into the labor force, keeping the unemployment rate elevated and providing the economy more room to run without stoking inflation. But the labor force shrank in both October and November, giving the Fed another reason to make a move this week and stick with its previous forecast of two rate hikes next year and three in 2018.

If you were to wait any longer, you would risk getting behind the curve, says JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli. The Fed held off on rate increases earlier this year in response to Chinas slowdown and a sluggish U.S. economy, among other factors.

The future roadmap is fuzzier. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion plan to upgrade the nations infrastructure and sharp tax cuts, a stimulus package that, if passed by Congress, could fuel inflation and force the Fed to lift rates more rapidly.

But, Its probably too early for the Fed to incorporate any fiscal policy issues into their forecast, Duy says. Its similarly too soon, he says, to anticipate  negative economic fallout from Trumps restrictive trade proposals.

On the other hand, the prospect of more federal spending and faster economic growth and inflation under Trump already has strengthened the dollar and pushed up long-term interest rates. Those developments tend to crimp the economy by hurting U.S. exports and discouraging consumer and business borrowing.

If they were to persist or intensify next year, the Fed may raise rates more gradually than anticipated, especially if the faster growth portended by Trumps plan hasnt yet materialized, Feroli says.",R
Trumps vow to undo Obama rules? Not so fast,"WASHINGTON  President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a vow to repeal what he claims are job-killing federal regulations, including rules limiting power plant emissions, protecting rivers and streams, and preventing banks from reckless lending.

Easier said than done.

The same deliberate process used to enact the Clean Power Plant rule, the waters of the U.S. Clean Water Rule, or regulations under the Dodd-Frank law designed to clamp down on Wall Street usually requires the same long slog to undo them, making quick repeal unattainable.

In general, rule changes originate from the agencies who must offer a legal, scientific or other legitimate reason in defense of the proposed change, and solicit public comments first before a new rule or its repeal can take effect. In most cases, the final rule may not become effective until at least 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register.

The process is laborious, but that shouldnt stop every agency head from setting it in motion, Andy Koenig, vice president of policy at the Koch-affiliated Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a recent column on the groups website. The very fact that it is so time-consuming makes it essential for agencies to start the process immediately.

Republicans seek quick repeal of latest Obama administration regulations
Small businesses can expect policy changes under Trump
But a Republican president and a compliant Congress controlled by Republicans can still do quite a bit in short order to block a host of proposed regulations or reverse rules that were recently implemented. Overall, critics say regulations pose a $4 trillion drag  on to the U.S. economy every year, according to some estimates, though agencies also design rules to maximize economic benefits.

Stakeholders have been weighing in about the rules they'd like to see tossed.

Among them is the House Freedom Caucus, the hard right faction of House lawmakers who have clashed with congressional leaders in recent years. The group Wednesday asked the incoming Trump administration to jettison 227 rules its members view as burdensome, costly or unworkable, including ones setting nutrition standards for school lunches, requiring certain animal and plant inspections, and development of alternative fuels.

Despite some steep hurdles, heres what Trump and Congress can do:

Incoming presidents can prevent regulations that have yet to be finalized from ever taking effect.

Its standard practice for a new administration to freeze any regulations that are in the pipeline until the incoming regime can review them, said Jerry Ellig, senior research fellow at George Mason Universitys Mercatus Center.

President Obama did just than when he came into office in 2009, as did his predecessors.

If its something that the current administration has finished and sent to the Federal Register but it isnt published before Inauguration Day, then its easy for a new administration to pull those rules back, he said.

Many could still go forward after the review is complete and the Trump administration supports them.

Congress also has a limited window where it can undo rules with a simple majority vote that cannot be filibustered. 

Such resolutions of disapproval must be passed and signed within 60 legislative days from their publication in the federal register and their insertion into the Congressional Record.

Under the Congressional Review Act, agencies must report on their rulemaking activities to Congress and provide lawmakers a legislative roadmap to overturn those rules if they oppose them, according to the Congressional Research Service.

The Mercatus Center lists 172 Obama administration rules adopted since June 9 that could be subject to the review act. They include rules on implementing school wellness policies, regulating municipal solid waste landfills and food labeling guidelines.

But the incoming Congress will have to be picky because the law requires that rule reversals can only be done one at a time. With all the other priorities facing them such as working on a budget and considering Trumps nominees, theres may not be much floor time for wholesale regulatory rollback, Ellig said.

That hurdle helps explain why the Congressional Review Act has been used only once since it became law 20 years ago. In 2001, Congress and the George W. Bush administration overturned a Clinton administration rule setting an ergonomics standard for the workplace.

Agencies can decide not to enforce certain regulations because theyre focused on other priorities. Or the Trump administration could choose to stop defending rules if they are the subject of a court challenge.

That passive approach is a pretty easy way to undermine laws that are already around and public protections that already exist, said Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizens Congress Watch, a government watchdog group.

Deciding not to defend the regulation in court wouldnt guarantee the rules demise.

Affected third parties would likely still be arguing for its enforcement and judges could still rule on the legality of the provision. But it could leave open questions that we would obviously rather have answered about our regulatory state, Gilbert said.

Lawmakers could pass a law undoing the rule.

The cleanest  and in many ways steepest  path to eliminating a rule is to have Congress approve legislation doing just that.

Thats what it will probably take to gut some of the Obama administrations most high-profile regulations, such as ones associated with clean water, clean power, overtime protections, the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform.

Within that category, there are several approaches: using spending bills to insert language known as riders preventing an agency from allocating funds to enforce a regulation, using a process known as reconciliation to fast-track bills to undo rules, and passing bills through the regular legislative process.

That last option is least desirable for regulatory reformers because it could take years, and it gives Democrats the chance to stop a rule rollback through filibuster.

None of this includes the executive orders that President Trump could undo with a stroke of his pen, namely President Obama's deportation protections for millions of undocumented immigrants who arrived here as young children.

Trump has already unveiled his plan to tackle regulation reform: Ask all department heads to submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs, and which does not improve public safety, and eliminate them.

Gilbert, with Public Citizen, said its hard to predict how many of the Obama-era rules will survive.

Our success in (preserving) any of them is going to depend on our ability to make it very clear to the American public ... what it means to take away these things that are so populist, so important, she said. Nobody wants to lose pay raises theyve already achieved or protections of their health and their air.",R
Obamacare Has Its Biggest Day as Republicans Promise Repeal,"A record number of Americans signed up for Obamacare Thursday on what they thought would be the last day to enroll in health insurance coverage that starts in the new year, President Barack Obama said Friday.

So many people visited the federal government website that the administration extended the deadline until early next week to give more people time to sign up for what could be the last year of Obamacare coverage.

The Republicans who will control Congress and the White House starting next month say they'll repeal the law that provides the insurance markets as soon as they can  although there's no clear plan for how, when or what to put in its place.

Obama plugged the health insurance marketplace, the centerpiece of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, in his last press conference of the year before heading to Hawaii for vacation.

""Yesterday was the biggest day ever for Healthcare.gov. More than 670,000 Americans signed up to get coverage,"" Obama said.

""SINCE I SIGNED OBAMACARE INTO LAW, OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ADDED MORE THAN 15 MILLION NEW JOBS.""
That's compared to 600,000 sign-ups last year on the Dec. 15 deadline.

Obama said when he took office, 44 million Americans lacked health insurance. ""Today, we have covered more than 20 million of them,"" he said. ""For the first time in history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured.""

Republican opponents of Obamacare don't dispute the coverage numbers but say the law has failed to bring down costs for consumers, as had been promised.

Premiums have risen as insurance companies taking part in the exchanges have struggled to make the profits they seek given the other restrictions imposed by the law. Obamacare limits the ability to charge higher premiums for women and older people, and it forces insurers to take all comers, even people who are already sick.

But the publicity over higher premiums didn't seem to scare off new customers. The Department of Health and Human Services said more than 4 million people have signed up for coverage on Healthcare.gov, compared to about 2.8 million enrollments by the first week of December last year. That includes 1.1 million people not covered before and 2.9 million renewals.

""YESTERDAY WAS BIGGEST DAY EVER FOR HEALTHCARE.GOV. MORE THAN 670,000 AMERICANS SIGNED UP TO GET COVERAGE.""
Most people who buy private insurance on the health insurance marketplaces get a hefty federal subsidy to help pay the premiums. An analysis by the Center for Health and Economy found those subsidies would cost $42.6 billion next year, an increase of nearly $10 billion over this year.

The enrollment numbers do not include 12 health insurance marketplaces run by states and Washington, D.C. independently of the federal government.

The new demand could help improve profitability for insurers, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ""If the current (Affordable Care Act) open enrollment period is successful and enrollment grows, it means the insurance market is not collapsing,"" he said via Twitter.

""Because of the extraordinary demand, we extended the deadline to sign-up for January 1 coverage by two business days until 11:59 pm PST December 19. We don't yet know how many people will take advantage of this extension, but nearly a million consumers left their contact information to hold their place in line,"" HHS said in a statement.

Obama on Friday took a shot at critics who said the law would hurt business and employment by requiring larger employers to cover their workers.

""Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs,"" he said.",R
"Which candidates did the seven ""faithless"" electors support?","A historic number of faithless electors -- seven in total--each cast their ballots on Monday for a candidate other than the one who won his or her state. What may be more surprising, given the level of protests against Donald Trump and the pressure exerted on Republican electors, is that a greater number were untrue to Hillary Clinton than to Mr. Trump.

Among the 538 electors chosen to represent their states in the Electoral College, five were faithless to the Democratic nominee and two to the Republican. Prior to this year, there hasnt been more than one faithless elector in any presidential election since 1948.

What is next for the Electoral College?
Among the Democratic faithless electors was David Mulinix, of Hawaii, who cast his vote for Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton. He said he believes the Electoral College is outdated, according to Hawaii News Now, which also pointed out that though Hawaii forbids faithless electors, Mulinixs vote still counted and he would face no punishment because Hawaii has never bothered to come up with a penalty for breaking the law.

Four of the faithless electors came from Washington, a state won by Clinton. Three of them--Bret Chiafalo, 19-year-old Levi Guerra, and Esther John-- cast their votes for former Secretary of State Colin Powell, according to the Seattle Times. They also participated in a movement started by Chiafalo. The so-called Hamilton Electors base their ideology on Alexander Hamilton--one of the Founding Fathers who wrote about the Electoral College in the Federalist Papers.  

The fourth faithless elector, Robert Satiacum, voted for Faith Spotted Eagle--a woman who is a member of the Yankton Sioux Nation, according to a local NBC affiliate. She played a public role in opposing the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.

President-elect Trump lost Texas elector Christopher Suprun to John Kasich. Another Texas elector, Bill Greene, voted for Libertarian Ron Paul, according to the Texas Monthly. 

Though there is no Constitutional provision or federal law barring electors from voting for whom they are pledged, more than half of the states, including D.C., bind their electors. The rest of electors may have the legal authority to vote for whomever they want, but, as CBS News previously reported, faithless electors have never decided a presidential election.

The entire procedure lasted well into the evening, with the official tally coming in around 8 p.m--though the president-elect clinched the nomination with the necessary 270 votes earlier in the evening. According to a final tally, Trump received 304 votes compared to Clintons 227.

The votes cast Monday will be sent on to the nations capital by late December. Subsequently, on Jan. 6, Vice President Joe Biden will open the electoral votes before a joint session of the new Congress, where they will be counted one last time.",R
Labor Secretary Tom Perez: Trump transition probes illegal,"Labor Secretary Tom Perez called presidential transition questions sent to government agencies like the Energy department, seeking to identify employees who worked on climate change, against the law.

Those questions have no place in a transition, Perez said. That is illegal.

DNC prepares to pick its next leader
Last week, President-elect Trumps transition team sent the State Department a memo requesting information on its gender-related staffing, programming, and funding. However, the document did not request specific names of employees working on those programs.

Will dedicated career people be targeted because they were doing the right work? Perez said.

He said he isnt aware of any similar blanket questions posed to the Labor Department.

The president-elects transition team responded to Perezs comments in statement saying the transition has a memorandum of understanding in place with the administration, and we continue to uphold both of our ends in this agreement.

President-elect Trump has nominated businessman Andy Puzder to replace Perez as head of the Labor Department. Puzder is CEO of CKE restaurants which owns the fast food chains Hardees and Carls Jr. He has argued against raising the minimum wage.

Perez is now running for Chair of the Democratic National Committee. He criticized the Democratic Party for neglecting Rust Belt states, where Mr. Trump trounced Hillary Clinton.

Organizing cant consist of going to a church every four years in October and saying vote for me, Perez said.

President Obama nominated Perez as Labor Secretary in 2013. Perez championed Mr. Obamas efforts to expand overtime pay to millions of Americans. A Texas judge blocked a Labor Department rule expanding overtime in November. But Perez is promising to focus on similar efforts if elected DNC Chair.

You dont have to lower wages in order to move forward. You can lift wages and lift prosperity for everybody.

Perez faces Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellisona favorite of some progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermonts Sen. Bernie Sanders (I). Other names of potential DNC Chair challengers are also being floated.

Ellison is pushing to strengthen what he calls the grassroots of the party.

We have got to just make sure the Democratic rank-and-file really owns the party, feels that it is theirs, Ellison told Face the Nation moderator John Dickerson.

Ellison has promised to work as DNC Chair full-time, resigning from Congress, if elected.

Perez, too, vowed to work full-time as DNC Chair, saying hed put aside a possible run for Governor of Maryland challenging popular Republican incumbent Larry Hogan.",R
Congressional Republicans Begin to Buck Trump on Russia,"Congressional Republicans have largely sought to minimize differences between President-elect Donald Trump and GOP establishment orthodoxy on a variety of issues, but signs of tension have begun to emerge over U.S. relations with Russia.

Over two days, Republicans in the Senate have publicly disagreed with or questioned decisions and statements made by Trump amidst rising tensions and allegations of Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election.

It's a different tact than Republicans have taken on disagreements over domestic policy. Elected officials in Congress have either downplayed division or stayed silent on issues of infrastructure spending, trade and entitlement reform.

But since Trump's announcement of his intention to appoint ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of State, at least four Senate Republicans have indicated that Tillerson should have to answer tough questions about his views on Russia and what is considered to be his close relationship with President Vladimir Putin.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C , said he has ""many questions"" for Tillerson. ""I expect the US-Russian relationship to be front and center in his confirmation process,"" he said in a statement.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said he has ""serious concerns about his nomination.""

""The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America's interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America's foreign policy goals to the president, within the administration, and on the world stage,"" Rubio added.

Likely to be dissected during the confirmation process is Tillerson's business interests and questions of how he would deal with any possible conflict. ExxonMobile is set to make hundreds of billions of dollars, for instance, if sanctions are lifted from Russia placed on the country after their invasion of Ukraine and Crimea.

Concern over Tillerson comes just one day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he backs a Senate investigation into the Russian hacking of U.S. political entities, including the Democratic National Committee. Trump has called a CIA intelligence report confirming the Russian ties ""ridiculous.""

While McConnell said that oversight of Russia must not become a partisan issue, he added that Republicans have always been critical of Russia.

""It defies belief that somehow republicans in the senate are reluctant to either review Russian tactics or ignore them,"" McConnell said.

But the incoming Republican president has espoused a dramatically different view of Russia. He complimented Putin throughout the campaign and has said that he'd like a more friendly and cooperative relationship with the country that 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called the United States' main geopolitical threat.

""This is one of these times when one party controls both the executive branch and two houses of Congress, but they're not in sync with the policy agenda. So it's a real question of if partisan loyalty overtakes substantive policy and personal prerogatives,"" Schmitt said.

N.Y. attorney general's office: Trump can't shut down foundation until investigation ends,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Donald Trump cannot move ahead with his plan to dismantle his charitable foundation because state prosecutors are probing whether the president-elect personally benefited from its spending, the New York attorney generals office said Tuesday.

The Trump foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete, said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

The statement came after Trump announced that he wanted to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office Jan. 20.

But the foundations inner workings have been the subject of Schneidermans investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for Trumps incoming administration. Democrats nationally have said they are ready to raise any legal or ethical issues from Trumps global business empire during his presidency.

Trumps charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.

President-elect announces he will shutter Trump Foundation
The admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were in a 2015 tax filing made public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contribution and purchase items, such as a painting of himself, that was displayed at one of his properties.

The 2015 tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar on Nov. 18 by someone using an email address from the foundations law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie Enterline Fekeci.

In the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But the tax filing doesnt provide details on the violations.

Schneiderman, a Democrat, launched his investigation into the charity after reporting by The Washington Post drew attention to some of the foundations purchases.

Trump asserted on Twitter late Monday that his foundation was run efficiently.

The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses, the president-elect tweeted. 100% of the money goes to wonderful charities.",R
Inside the Clinton Email Search Warrant,"The search warrant that authorized the FBI to examine a laptop in connection with Hillary Clintons use of a private email server as secretary of state was released today, and the Clinton camp says it shows that Director James Comey's ""intrusion"" into the election was ""utterly unjustified.""

Clinton had been dogged by the issue of her private email server throughout the campaign and Comey dealt a surprise blow when he said that the FBI was looking into the emails found on former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner's computer just days before the election.

According to the warrant and supporting documents, investigators said they found thousands of emails belonging to top Hillary Clinton adviser Huma Abedin on the computer belonging to her estranged husband, Weiner. Both of their names are redacted.

The laptop's hard drive, according to sources, was being examined in unrelated investigations into alleged sexting by Weiner.

Warrant Related to Clinton Emails to Be Unsealed Tuesday
Warrant Obtained to Start Reviewing Emails Found on Laptop Used by Clinton Aide
FBI Says Review of New Emails Doesn't Change Conclusion Clinton Shouldn't Be Charged
When discovered, the FBI believed the emails were ""outside the scope"" of their investigation into Weiner, and did not look at them beyond the subject line and e-mail address information, according to the newly released documents.

According to the affidavit, the FBI had already reviewed more than 30,000 emails and found 2,115 contained classified information, including 22 with Top Secret information.

Analysis of those emails ""revealed more than 4,000 work-related emails between [redacted] and Clinton from 2009 and 2013."" The redaction is believed to refer to Abedin.

According to the affidavit, the FBIs prior investigation found that among the 4,000, some 27 email chains containing classified information ""have been transmitted through [redacted] and/or [redacted] accounts,"" which again are believed to be between Abedin and Clinton.

""Because it has been determined by relevant original classification authorities that many emails were exchanged between [redacted] and/or [redacted] accounts and Clinton that contained classified information, there is also probable cause to believe that the correspondence between them located on Subject Laptop contains classified information,"" the affidavit says.

The FBI search of the laptop came during the final days of the presidential election, months after Comey announced that the bureau had effectively closed its investigation.

E. Randol Schoenberg, a Los Angeles attorney who petitioned to have the documents unsealed, said in a statement to ABC News he was ""appalled.""

""I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Secretary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin,"" he said.

On Oct. 28, Comey disclosed to Congress that the FBI would be looking at the newly discovered emails, but it remains unclear when the emails were discovered and how long it took for that information to be communicated to Comey. The warrant was approved two days later.

Just two days before the election, Comey issued a second letter to Congress, stating, ""based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.""

It's unclear what impact Comey's letters had on the election, but Clinton told top donors that she thought Comey's letter to Congress was a turning point in the contest between her and now President-elect Donald Trump.

Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted today that ""the unsealed filings regarding Huma's emails reveals Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time.""

Stephen Saltzburg, George Washington University Law Professor, said that Comey didn't need to ""run the risk"" of making Clinton look even worse right before the election -- a move that broke with FBI protocol about commenting on ongoing investigations.

""They [FBI] had to assure themselves that there was no classified information at risk on a computer that they didnt have. They had no obligation, however, to go public about what they were doing,"" he said.

Officials at both the FBI and the Department of Justice declined to comment to ABC News.",R
Preexisting Conditions and Republican Plans to Replace Obamacare,"As debate about Obamacares future moves from peoples general, mostly partisan views of the Affordable Care Act to details and consequences of plans to repeal and replace the ACA, one of the biggest flash points is likely to be how people with pre-existing medical conditions are affected.

Across the U.S., people who have cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or other serious conditions will want to know whether they or their sick family members will be able to get and afford coverage in the future. Their partisan views about Obamacare are likely to quickly be supplanted by these more practical concerns. And a substantial number of people could be affected.

A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis to be released next week found that almost 30% of U.S. adults younger than 65 have health conditions that would have left them uninsurable in a pre-ACA world. Many more people have conditions with which they could still qualify for coverage before ACA protections took effectbut only at premiums they could not afford. Many people with conditions over which coverage could be declined before the ACA live in big red states (there are more than 4 million in Texas, for example) and in blue states (nearly 6 million in California). As the chart above shows, however, the 11 states with the largest shares of adults who have pre-existing conditions are all controlled by Republicans, and most are in the South. These states have higher rates of residents with conditions over which coverage was declined before the ACA, such as obesity and diabetes.

Still, even more Americans may feel that they have a stake in policies regarding pre-existing conditions. Kaisers monthly health tracking poll found in August that 53% of Americans said that they or a family member had a pre-existing condition after being read a definition of the term. Most people with pre-existing conditions are insured at any given time through employer plans or public programs such as Medicaid. Before the ACA, however, they would have been unable to get coverage again if they lost their insurance through a change in circumstances. Because so many people with a pre-existing condition have to worry about whether their circumstances might change someday, a much larger share of the public is likely to be interested in this issue than the number of people who stand to be affected immediately by policy changes.

President-elect Donald Trump has said that he wants to protect people who have pre-existing medical conditions. Details of Republican health-care plans are not yet known, but they are expected to involve establishing high-risk pools within states, among other measures. Without the plan details it is hard to say how strong protections will be.

Tens of millions of people with pre-existing medical conditions and the influential groups that represent them will be interested in details of legislative plans to change the ACA and how they might be affected. Its sometimes said that this has become a post-factual world. But as health care moves from a campaign issue to the legislative agenda, people will want to know how changes would affect them, and details and facts will matter more again.

Trump wins Electoral College vote as insurgency fizzles,"WASHINGTON  Donald Trump will  officially  become president next month.

Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed from 538 electors casting their ballots, in a day of normally ceremonial voting that drew attention amid intense social media pressure and protests in state capitols.

Despite a last-minute push by outside progressive and Libertarian groups, there was no rebellion. In fact, most of the ""faithless"" electors appeared to be Hillary Clinton defectors in Washington state, with three voting for former secretary of State Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American an environmental activist. Two Texas GOP electors went rogue and didn't vote for Trump.

The meetings, which occur more than a month after the Nov. 8 election, are typically a formality. This year, Trump critics mounted a vocal campaign appealing to the Republican electors pledged to vote for him. The official results of the vote will be announced before Congress on Jan. 6, although the results from each state were released throughout the day Monday.

Is this any way to choose a president? Only half of Americans think so
GOP electors targeted with $500K ad buy in final anti-Trump push
Aides: Critics trying to use Electoral College to de-legitimize Trump
Electors received thousands of emails and phone calls arguing Trump is unqualified, as the first president in the nations history with no military or government experience and with potential conflicts of interest due to his business empire. Confirmation by the FBI and CIA that the Russian government hacked Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee seeking to help Trump win the election have amplified their calls.

Frankly, at this point, I'm wondering if Putin helped Trump win the Republican primary,"" Chris Suprun, a Texas elector who's been an outspoken critic, said before the voting began. In Rhode Island, electors passed a motion calling for an independent, bipartisan investigation into Russian intervention in the election as Congress debates whether the matter should be reviewed by Republican-led committees or as an independent probe.

Thousands of protesters gathered outside state capitals throughout the country. Yet in the end, the rebellion fell far short of the dozens of potential faithless electors that some Trump opponents said could materialize.


Opponents would have needed 37 GOP electors to switch their votes. The one alternative to Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, had told electors not to vote for him. Even if there were a mass defection, the matter would have kicked to the Republican-led House of Representatives, which was unlikely to override their own partys president. Further, the Republican National Committee conducted a parallel whip effort to make sure electors stick to the plan to vote for Trump.

Clinton won more than 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide. But Trump won a majority of the 538 electoral votes  the state-by-state system created by the nation's founders based on the size of a states congressional delegation.

A short history lesson on presidents winning without the popular vote
Its the second time in recent history, including Democrat Al Gores loss in 2000 to George W. Bush, that the person winning the popular vote lost the election. Before that, it hadnt been since 1888, when Benjamin Harrison beat Grover Cleveland, that a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote.

The trend is causing Democrats to question the system by which the nation chooses its leaders, according to a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll. It finds 50% of registered voters believe the Electoral College should choose the president. Yet more than four in 10  42%  say the Constitution should be amended so the popular vote prevails in choosing the commander in chief. Liberals are most likely to want a change while conservatives want to keep the current system.

Trump assumes the mantle with an electorate deeply skeptical of his presidency, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. While the percentage of voters who view him positively has increased to 41%, thats 7 points less than those who view him unfavorably. While 45% said they were optimistic and satisfied about Trump as president, its 21 points below Obamas number in January 2009 and 14 points below George W. Bushs number at the same time in 2000.",R
New push to replace Obamacare reignites old GOP tensions,"Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obamas signature health-care law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before President-elect Donald Trump is even sworn in.

But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the laws insurance would go away.

Hard-liners are pushing to move as fast as possible, bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises. But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast.

While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom, a full replacement could take months, if not years.

Id like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes, said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the repeal and replace efforts. We have to live with the real world. And the real world right now is that the Democrats wont help with anything.

Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)
Hatch and other high-ranking Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until 2019 or beyond, allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections.

Many of them, like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly.

I dont want to leave the 84,000 people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because, all of a sudden, two-thirds of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy, Collins said.

But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues  many of them sent to Congress in the midterm, anti-Obama waves of 2010 and 2014  who see little reason to dawdle.

The history of this place is, the longer it takes, the more exponentially the probability grows that itll never get done, said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), elected recently as the new chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Republicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years, so why do we need three years?

Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan, despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now. Their foot-dragging is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits. Trump has also been vague, promising a terrific replacement that will provide great health care at a fraction of the cost.

The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacares sunset. But other fights loom  over what precisely a replacement plan should look like, whether Obamacares Medicaid expansion will continue, whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare, and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition.

 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor on Jan. 3. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
The battle lines, however, are familiar, with establishment Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents, mainly in the House, on the other. Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to retire.

Come Jan. 20, Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans, and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a health-care overhaul, the real fight will occur inside the GOP.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan. 3. But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets.

So far, Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace, but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute.

Were going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel, Vice President-elect Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently. The number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people.

Hard-liners on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trumps pick for health and human services secretary, as allies in their push for quick and decisive action. Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill with all deliberate speed but pledged only to then set into motion a process to replace it.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that Republicans would move as well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people.

Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing.

The idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace, he said.

Conservative activists who pushed a take-no-prisoners approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited.

When Republicans have the House, the Senate and the White House, you dont wait, said Adam Brandon, president and chief executive of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. Im a Cleveland Indians fan. I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades. When you have a shot to do it, you do it. Thats it.

Democrats and many health-care experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges. More than 12 million Americans are covered under those policies.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacares insurance exchanges, according to people familiar with her remarks inside the closed-door meeting.

Delayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue, because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers, providers, consumers and states, Burwell told reporters after the meeting.

Republicans want to end Obamacares system of penalties and subsidies. But many  including Trump  want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick.

Experts warn that repeal and delay under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market. Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said insurers could face as much as $3 billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated.

That $3 billion is the tip of the iceberg, Blumberg said. With all of these changes and the uncertainty, it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get.

Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments, something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers.

The insurance industry should understand that theres a new sheriff in town, said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a Freedom Caucus member. They signed up for Obamacare, and if they want to make a profit, theyre going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a free-market insurance industry.

The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base, but also Senate arithmetic.

There will be a slim 52-to-48 Republican majority come January, and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules, passing a complete replacement will require 60 votes.

Only by dismantling Obamacare first, Republicans say, will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan  and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so.

We all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all, Hatch said.

Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, has rejected that strategy. Were not going to do a replacement. If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it, he told The Washington Post recently.

But the Republican base, prodded by conservative media outlets and well-organized activist groups, has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction.

One prominent activist, Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, suggested that Trump could goose the repeal-and-replace efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to 11,000 congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law.

I dont think anyone thinks that youre going to flip a switch .?.?. but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly, she said. We want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done.

Brandon was even blunter: This is going to be a hard thing for Republicans, but tough [cookies], he said. Theyre going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers, and guess what? Its hard.

The political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place, he added. The old excuses of having divided government, theyre gone.

A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit. They have to look at the complexity of the problem here, and hopefully theyll recognize that its not quite so simple, said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave.

But many others are not.

Literally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress, said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), a first-termer who will chair the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. Weve got to act on it.",R
New Zealand's Parliament chooses new prime minister,"Bill English, New Zealands finance minister and a former farmer, will be sworn in as the countrys 39th prime minister on Monday after his colleagues in the Parliament chose him as their new leader. 

English emerged victorious from a meeting of the conservative National Party caucus. Two other candidates for the job withdrew last week after English gained more support than them. He is to be officially sworn in on Monday afternoon. 

His ascension from deputy prime minister follows the surprise resignation last week of John Key after eight years as prime minister. 

Key was a popular leader and was expected to contest a fourth straight election next year. But he said he wanted to leave while he was on top and to spend more time with his wife and two children. 

English, 54, has degrees in commerce and literature. He has been praised for his handling of the countrys economy in his role as finance minister. 

A practicing Roman Catholic, English has been a politician for 26 years, after he was first elected to the parliament in 1990. He had a previous unsuccessful stint as party leader, taking his party to a big election defeat in 2002. He said hes gained wisdom and experience since then. 

I was 39 years old then, with six children under 13, he said last week. So if nothing else, Ive got the opportunity to focus much more on the job now. 

Under English, New Zealand has been enjoying relatively robust annual GDP growth of more than 3 percent and the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent. English has also managed to return small surpluses on the governments books over the past couple of years.

"Obama ""permanently"" bans drilling in parts of Arctic, Atlantic","HONOLULU -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday designated the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing. 

The move helps put some finishing touches on Mr. Obamas environmental legacy while also testing President-elect Donald Trumps promise to unleash the nations untapped energy reserves. 

The White House announced the actions in conjunction with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which also placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters, subject to periodic review.

Mr. Obama is making use of an arcane provision in a 1953 law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently. The statute says that the president of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf. 

Environmental groups hope the ban, despite relying on executive powers, will be difficult for future presidents to reverse. The White House said its confident the presidents order will withstand legal challenge and said the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals. 

The Atlantic waters placed off limits to new oil and gas leasing are 31 canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia, though some had hoped for a more extensive ban that would have extended further south. 

Existing leases arent affected by the presidents executive actions. 

The administration cited environmental concerns in both regions to justify the moratorium. Mr. Obama also cited the importance of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in providing subsistence for native Alaskans and the vulnerability of the ecosystem to an oil spill to justify his directive. 

Mr. Obama also noted the level of fuel production occurring in the Arctic. Mr. Obama said just 0.1 percent of offshore crude production came from the Arctic in 2015, and at current oil prices, significant production would not occur in future decades. 

Thats why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector, Mr. Obama said. 

Still, industry officials objected to Mr. Obamas memorandum, calling it last minute political rhetoric. 

Instead of building on our nations position as a global energy leader, todays unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come, said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. 

And Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said Mr. Obamas move marginalized local voices. He said no one is more invested than Alaskans in making sure Arctic habitats are protected. 

To lock it up against any further exploration or development activity is akin to saying that the voices of activists who live in Lower 48 cities have a greater stake than those to whom the Arctic is our front yard and our back yard, he said in a statement. 

In issuing a permanent ban, Mr. Obama appears to be trying to tie the hands of his successor. Mr. Trump has vowed a domestic energy revolution and is filling his Cabinet with nominees deeply opposed to Mr. Obamas environmental and climate change actions. 

Environmental groups were calling for a permanent ban even before the presidential election, but Mr. Trumps victory has provided greater urgency for them and for businesses that rely on tourism and fishing. Mr. Trump has said he intends to use all available fuel reserves for energy self-sufficiency - and that its time to open up offshore drilling. 

This decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling, which promises smaller, short-lived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods, said Jacqueline Savitz, a senior vice president at the advocacy group, Oceana. 

A key question to be answered is how difficult it will be for future presidents to overturn Mr. Obamas decision should they seek to do so. 

The American Petroleum Institute pointed to 2008 when President George W. Bush used a simple memorandum to remove previously withdrawn lands and make all Outer Continental Shelf lands available for leasing except marine sanctuaries. 

Fortunately, there is no such thing as a permanent ban, said the institutes Erik Milito. 

But White House officials in a conference call with reporters said previous indefinite withdrawals remain in place and voiced confidence that Mr. Obamas decision will stand. 

Advocacy groups were already warning that they were prepared to file suit to protect the ban during future administrations. 

If Donald Trump tries to reverse President Obamas withdrawals, he will find himself in court, said Marissa Knodel of Friends of the Earth. 

Frank Knapp, president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce in Columbia, said he was extremely disappointed in the decision not to extend drilling protections to the entire Atlantic seaboard. 

Knapp and his group were among a number of business groups in the southeast who had advocated for banning new drilling leases off their shores, arguing that the environmental impacts would hurt fishing, tourism and other businesses the region relies upon. Hed gone to Washington to meet with Obama administration officials, and believed the entire Atlantic was to be protected. 

The decision came as Mr. Obama spends the holidays in Hawaii. Some Democratic lawmakers applauded Obama, while some Republicans were highly critical. 

As President-elect Trump nominates fossil fuel allies to his Cabinet, President Obama has instead put the interests of millions of Americans ahead of those of Big Oil with these permanent protections, said Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. 

The extremes to which this president will go to appease special interests never ceases to amaze, countered Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. This is not a moral calling; its an abuse of power.",R
Leak reveals Rex Tillerson was director of Bahamas-based US-Russian oil firm,"Rex Tillerson, the businessman nominated by Donald Trump to be the next US secretary of state, was the long-time director of a US-Russian oil firm based in the tax haven of the Bahamas, leaked documents show.

Tillerson  the chief executive of ExxonMobil  became a director of the oil companys Russian subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas, in 1998. His name  RW Tillerson  appears next to other officers who are based at Houston, Texas; Moscow; and Sakhalin, in Russias far east.


 Who is Donald Trumps secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson?
The leaked 2001 document comes from the corporate registry in the Bahamas. It was one of 1.3m files given to the Germany newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung by an anonymous source. The registry is public but details of individual directors are typically incomplete or missing entirely. 

Though there is nothing untoward about this directorship, it has not been reported before and is likely to raise fresh questions over Tillersons relationship with Russia ahead of a potentially stormy confirmation hearing by the US senate foreign relations committee. Exxon said on Sunday that Tillerson was no longer a director after becoming the companys CEO in 2006.

ExxonMobils use of offshore regimes  while legal  may also jar with Trumps avowal to put America first.

Tillersons critics say he is too close to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and that his appointment could raise potential conflicts of interest.

ExxonMobil is the worlds largest oil company and has for a long time been eyeing Russias vast oil and gas deposits. Tillerson currently has Exxon stock worth more than $200m.


Since his nomination, Tillersons Russia ties have become a source of bipartisan concern. In 2013, Putin awarded him the Russian Order of Friendship. Tillerson is close to Igor Sechin, the head of Russian state oil company Rosneft and the de facto second most powerful figure inside the Kremlin. A hardliner, Sechin is ex-KGB.

Tillersons award followed a 2011 deal between ExxonMobil and Rosneft to explore the Kara Sea, in Russias Arctic.

It was put on hold in 2014 after the Obama administration imposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russia. The sanctions were punishment for Putins Crimea annexation that spring and Russias undercover invasion of eastern Ukraine.

The ban covers the US sharing of sophisticated offshore and shale oil technology. Exxon was supposed to halt its drilling with Rosneft. The firm successfully pleaded with the US Treasury department to delay the ban by a few weeks, with the Kremlin threatening to seize its rig. In this brief window Exxon discovered a major Arctic field with some 750m barrels of new oil.

Tillerson has criticised the US governments policy on Russia. In 2014 he told Exxons annual meeting that we do not support sanctions. He added: We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who they are really harming.

It is widely assumed by investors that the new Trump administration will drop sanctions. This would allow the Kara joint venture to resume, boosting Exxons share price and yielding potential profits in the tens of billions of dollars. According to company records, Tillerson currently owns $218m of stock. His Exxon pension is worth about $70m.

The Senate foreign relations committee is currently split 10 to 9 between Republicans and Democrats. But several heavyweight Republicans, including John McCain, have raised doubts about Tillersons nomination and his lack of experience to be Americas top diplomat after four decades spent exclusively in the oil industry.

Republican senator Marco Rubio  who sits on the committee  said on Tuesday that he had serious concerns about giving Tillerson the job. Rubio praised him as a respected businessman but said that the next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity [and who] has a clear sense of Americas interests.

Tillerson is likely to get rid of his Exxon stock if the narrowly Republican-majority Senate confirms his appointment.

Controversy over his links with Russia comes at a time when the topic is politically red hot, after the CIA said earlier this month that Kremlin hackers had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats in order to help Trump. The president-elect has dismissed the CIAs assessment, calling it ridiculous. The Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, says Putin targeted her for reasons of personal revenge.

As well as on oil and gas, the Obama administration has imposed personal sanctions on Putins friends, including Sechin. Sechin has said that one of his ambitions is to ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson. Currently, Sechin is forbidden from entering the country.

This new revelation about Tillersons directorship sheds light on the use by multinational companies of contrived offshore structures, now under scrutiny following Aprils massive Panama Papers leak.

Exxon Neftegass most important oil and gas project is Sakhalin-1. It is located in the sub-Arctic, off the frozen and difficult-to-access north-east coast of Russias Sakhalin island. This is 10,700km (6,650 miles) away from the subsidiarys official business home in Nassau, the semi-tropical capital of the Bahamas. The Bahamas is notorious for secrecy and has a corporate tax rate of zero.

The documents from the Bahamas corporate registry were shared by Sddeutsche Zeitung with the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC. They show that Exxon registered at least 67 companies in the secretive tax haven, covering operations in countries from Russia to Venezuela to Azerbaijan.

Exxon Neftegas features in about 25 leaked offshore documents. The oil firm was incorporated in 1998 by a law firm in Nassau, Higgs & Johnson. Another veteran law firm, Lobosky Management Ltd, subsequently took over as registered agent. The company secretary, Sophia Kishinevsky, signed the paperwork and made annual filings.

Exxon said it had no comment on whether Tillerson should now divest his Exxon holdings and resign from his positions with all Exxon entities. It said the oil firm had incorporated some of its affiliates in the Bahamas because of simplicity and predictability.

It is not done to reduce tax in the country where the company operates, Exxon said. Incorporation of a company in the Bahamas does not decrease ExxonMobils tax liability in the country where the entity generates its income.

The firm was one of the largest taxpayers in the world, with an effective global tax rate in 2015 of 34%, it said. Its effective tax rate over the past three years  2013, 2014, 2015  was 43%, it added. This compared favourably with other Fortune 100 companies, which have substantially lower effective tax rates than ExxonMobil.",R
NSA watchdog put on leave in whistleblower case,"WASHINGTON -- Allegations of retaliation against a whistleblower at the National Security Agency have left its top watchdog fighting for his job, according to an intelligence official and another individual familiar with the case.

The case could offer some credence to Edward Snowdens claim that he could not have reported the governments domestic surveillance program without facing reprisals.

George Ellard, the NSAs inspector general, was placed on administrative leave after he refused to give the whistleblower a certain job assignment. The Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, first reported last week that Adm. Mike Rogers, director of NSA, had placed Ellard on leave and recommended that he be terminated. Ellard is appealing that decision.

Ellard received attention in 2014 for remarks at Georgetown University Law Center criticizing Snowden, the former NSA contractor who had leaked secret documents about the surveillance program. Snowden says he went public because he feared retaliation from his superiors if he had raised his concerns with them. Ellard said at Georgetown that Snowden could have safely come to him.

Ellards case is the first to move completely through a process created by President Barack Obama in 2012 to ensure that intelligence employees can effectively report waste, fraud and abuse while protecting classified information. The directive prohibits agencies from retaliating against them or taking away security clearances or an employees access to classified information.

The case stemmed from a whistleblowers claims of financial misconduct by NSA officials involving a conference in Nashville, Tennessee.

The whistleblower, in a brief email to The Associated Press, said that after he raised his concerns, his name was disclosed to Ellard in violation of rules intended to protect government employees who want to report misconduct.

The whistleblower said his email response had been cleared by the NSA. The agency declined to comment independently on the case. Ellards attorney did not respond to requests for comment.

Its not clear who revealed the whistleblowers identity to Ellard. But the whistleblower said that after Ellard learned who he was, I was denied an assignment within the NSA inspector generals office of investigations because of my whistleblowing. He sent the email to the AP on condition of anonymity because the case is still active.

Rogers decision to recommend Ellards dismissal followed an eight-month investigation by a panel of inspectors general at the CIA, Treasury and Justice Department, according to an intelligence official, who was not authorized to disclose details about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. The trio was empaneled in October 2015 and issued its decision in May.

The Justice and Defense departments declined to comment on the decision.

Louis Clark, director of the Government Accountability Project, said he was happy that the process set up by Obamas directive was finally being used, but expressed disappointment that it has taken so long for it to happen. It was so slow because the intelligence agencies are extremely hostile to whistleblowing, he said.

The fate of Obamas directive is uncertain. It will be up to Donald Trump, after he becomes president, to decide whether to continue it. Trump has said he doesnt trust the intelligence agencies, but its not clear if that would make him more or less likely to protect whistleblowers.

Timothy Edgar, Obamas first director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff, says there is cause for serious concern about the future of whistleblowers.

What were left with, I think, is probably primarily the integrity and bravery of people in the bureaucracy, who, despite those obstacles are willing to say no if they are involved in activities that they think are serious violations of the Constitution, Edgar said.",R
Electoral College Vote Seals Trump White House Victory,"The Electoral College formalized Donald Trump's election victory on Monday despite protests around the country to encourage GOP electors to abandon the Republican.

The president-elect easily racked up the 270 electoral votes needed to send him to the White House. Interest in the normally mundane voting process spiked this year as opposition to Trump continues to fester, fueled by Clinton's success in capturing over 2.6 million more votes than her Republican opponent.

""Today marks a historic electoral landslide victory in our nation's democracy,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I thank the American people for their overwhelming vote to elect me as their next President of the United States.""

He added, ""this election represents a movement that millions of hard working men and women all across the country stood behind and made possible. With this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead. I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans.""

Anti-Trump protesters descended on state capitols throughout the U.S. in a last-ditch effort to persuade so-called ""faithless electors"" in states Trump won to change their vote. Many of the Republicans casting ballots said they were inundated with calls and emails urging them to dump Trump.

And some electors did break with how their state voted, albeit in unexpected ways. In Washington, a state Clinton won by 16 points, the former secretary of state received just eight of the state's 12 electoral votes. Colin Powell received three votes and Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle received one as part of an effort to promote a candidate other than Trump.

 See Protester Interrupt Wisconsin Electoral College Vote 0:42
An elector in both Maine and Minnesota attempted to cast a ballot for Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully challenged Clinton in the Democratic primary. However state laws requiring electors to follow the statewide vote invalidated both efforts.

Only one Republican elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, publically pledged not to vote for Trump despite his state heavily favoring the president-elect last month. One other Texas elector also abandoned Trump in the final vote.

An Associated Press survey of the electoral college's 538 members found there was little interest from members in breaking from voting how their states did. Thirty-seven electors would have needed to defect from Trump to endanger him from winning.

The Electoral College met in all fifty states and Washington, D.C. on Monday. Congress will certify the results on Jan. 6 and the president will be inaugurated Jan. 20.

Walmart pulls 'Black Lives Matter' shirts from website after cop complaints,"Walmart removed several varieties of shirts and hoodies with the slogan Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter from its website, a spokesperson confirmed Wednesday, after a police union complained they were offensive.

Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise, said a spokesperson for the worlds largest retailer, with more than $482 billion in revenue. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the bulletproof reference.

The head of the Fraternal Order of Police wrote an open letter to Walmart Tuesday night requesting that the company to take down Black Lives Matter merchandise from its website. 

Canterbury wrote that the clothing would damage your companys good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers. The FOP calls itself the worlds largest law enforcement group, claiming more than 330,000 members in 2,200 lodges.

At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division, he added.

The right-wing website Breitbart drew attention to the presence of Black Lives Matter shirts on Walmarts site earlier this month, which prompted some on Twitter to call for a boycott of the retailer. 

Like many retailers doing business online, Walmart offers merchandise from third-party sellers on its website, which can be distinguished by a small note on the product page.

As of Wednesday afternoon, shirts with the Bulletproof slogan could not be found on Walmarts website. Plenty of other merchandise with phrases like Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter and even Journalists Lives Matter was available at $18 to $42 apiece.",R
Trump presidency: What his new team teaches us,"As Donald Trump's 20 January inauguration draws closer, the president-elect's administration is starting to take shape. What does it tell us about what we can expect from the Trump presidency?
Although the incoming president has to fill more than 4,000 executive branch jobs scattered across dozens of agencies, departments and bureaus, there are 21 top-level Cabinet positions that require Senate confirmation. So far the Trump transition team has announced nominees for 15 of the spots (a 16th, interior secretary, is reportedly going to Ryan Zinke of Montana).
First, the basics. Of those 16, 11 are white men. For the first time since 1993, none of the top four departments - state, defence, treasury or justice - will be headed by a woman or a member of an ethnic minority group.
Ben Carson, tapped for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is the only African American. Elaine Chao (transportation) and Nikki Haley (UN ambassador) are the only Asians.
Six have previously held elective office, and one - Ms Chao - has prior experience running a federal agency. That marks a significant change from past presidential administrations, which were well stocked with more experienced political hands.
Mr Trump's Cabinet is a mix of rich businessmen, former military leaders and conservative true-believers. He may have campaigned as an anti-establishment outsider, but he's mostly surrounding himself with powerful, wealthy, influential men. While many may be outsiders to the game of elective politics, they're not exactly drawn from the ranks of the angry populist masses.
Here's a closer look at how it all shakes out.

Rex Tillerson hopes to move from the ExxonMobil boardroom to White House Cabinet meetings
American voters elected a businessman with no political experience as their president, and he's filled many of his top administration jobs with businessmen who have no political experience.
Leading the way are Rex Tillerson, who has helmed the international energy conglomerate ExxonMobil since 2006, as secretary of state, and venture capitalist and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury.
Other notable picks include the so-called ""king of bankruptcy"", Wilbur Ross, for commerce and fast food mogul Andrew Puzder at Labor.
What we've learned: Mr Trump campaigned against a global elite that he said was stripping the working class of its wealth. By looking to Wall Street insiders and corporate chieftains for key administration spots, however, his post-election actions signal a decidedly different mentality.

Here come the generals
At one point during the campaign, Mr Trump quipped that he knew more about fighting the so-called Islamic State than many of the generals currently running US military operations. When it came time to fill out his national security apparatus, however, the president-elect has frequently turned to the military brass.

James Mattis is a former general that Donald Trump likes
James Mattis (defence) and John Kelly (homeland security) are both retired generals, as is Michael Flynn, who Mr Trump has slated for national security adviser (a position that does not require Senate confirmation).
Taken individually, the picks are unremarkable - ex-military leaders sometimes wind up in the presidential administrations of both Democrats and Republicans. Colin Powell was George W Bush's secretary of state, and David Petraeus ran the Central Intelligence Agency under Barack Obama.
Together, however, Mr Trump's picks give his administration a decidedly martial bent. While he may have mocked Mr Obama's generals, Mr Trump, who attended military school as a youth, seems inclined to favour the spit and polish of military leadership.
The military is one of the few institutions still viewed favourably by the American public, and Mr Trump seems more than happy to march along with it.
What we've learned: Candidate Trump often espoused a less interventionist foreign policy on the campaign trail, but President-elect Trump's decision to surround himself with generals could indicate he will be quicker on the trigger.

The vanquished
Former presidential candidate Rick Perry once called Mr Trump a cancer on the Republican Party. Ben Carson, another primary opponent, questioned the business mogul's religious faith. Now Mr Trump has chosen both to head Cabinet departments in his administration.

There's a certain amount of irony in Mr Perry's selection, given that he is slotted to head the Department of Energy, which he famously forgot the name of when listing Cabinet-level posts he'd cut during a 2008 Republican primary debate.
Although Mr Trump has only named two former adversaries to his administration, he's also rumoured to be considering former computer executive Carly Fiorina for an intelligence agency post. Then there's New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was reportedly offered several Cabinet-level positions after being passed over for attorney general.
He's a foe-turned-friend who now, it seems, has been forgotten.
What we've learned: Facing off against Mr Trump in the past isn't necessarily a deal-breaker for the president-elect, but a subsequent bent knee - offered both by Mr Carson and Mr Perry - is a key to bygones being bygones.

The insiders
According to a recent story in Politico, Mr Trump's transition team has been beset by conflicts between establishment party players, led by incoming chief-of-staff Reince Priebus, and the conservative outsiders who helped run the Trump campaign.
In a number of Cabinet positions, it appears the establishment landed the people they wanted. Tom Price, slated for Health and Human Services, is a member of the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. Betsy DeVos, heading to education, is a long-time conservative activist and Republican Party donor. Elaine Chao served as labour secretary under President George W Bush and is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, considered a party rising star, is the nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations.
Given that Mr Trump is likely to be a hands-off president when it comes to the day-to-day management of his administration, department heads will wield considerable power over the next four years.
While the president-elect has said there are portions of Barack Obama's healthcare reform that he likes, for instance, chances are Mr Price will use his health secretary authority to strip the programme of much of its power. While he may sit down with former Vice-President Al Gore to talk climate change, his Environmental Protection Agency nominee, Scott Pruitt, is an outspoken critic - and legal opponent - of the agency he will head.
What we've learned: Mr Trump railed against the political establishment on the campaign trail, but some of his nominees are very comfortable in the Washington ""swamp"". The tension between the insiders and the outsiders in the Trump transition team is likely to continue well into his presidency.

(She is also the largest donor to the Trump family's charitable foundation.)
Another Trump donor, Todd Ricketts, has landed a deputy position in the Commerce Department.
Meanwhile, some early, outspoken Trump advocates were passed over for plum positions - including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin and former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. They emerged from the political graveyard to take an early gamble on Mr Trump, but they have yet to be rewarded for their efforts.

GOP in Congress split over how to repeal Obamacare,"WASHINGTON  Republicans are united on repealing President Barack Obamas health care law, but ideologically and practically speaking, theyre in different camps over replacing it. Getting the factions together wont be easy.

Some Republicans would revise and rebrand Obamacare,  junking unpopular provisions like its requirement that most Americans carry health insurance, while preserving well-liked parts. Others would rip up the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and not replace it.

 Can Congress put aside differences in the new year?

Can Congress put aside differences in the new year?
President-elect Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders will have to unite the groups on complicated changes affecting the financial and physical well-being of millions of people. For some constituents in fragile health, its literally a life-and-death debate.

Republicans have a really narrow path, says Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute, a free-market health care research organization. Theyve got to deal with the politics of this, theyve got to make sure they come up with good policy, and they also have process challenges.

Success is not guaranteed, and Republicans may come to regret that their party defined itself as totally opposed to Obamacare.

Yet House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady seems unfazed by the challenge. Its like tax reform, says Brady, a Texas Republican, explaining that many pieces will be pulled together. Unlike Obamacare, which ripped up the individual market, this will be done deliberately, in an appropriate timetable.

Republicans say they will move quickly to repeal the ACA, while suspending the effective date to allow them to craft a replacement. Heres a look at the GOP camps and whos in them:

Revise and rebrand

Many Republicans may quietly be in this contingent, but fear being accused of promoting Obamacare-lite.

Theyd strip out some of the ACAs taxes and requirements. The unpopular individual mandate to carry health insurance or risk fines could be replaced with other persuasion short of a government dictate. Rules on insurers would be loosened.

But popular provisions such as protecting those with pre-existing health conditions would be retained in some form, as well as financial assistance for low- and moderate-income people. The requirement that health plans cover adult children until age 26 would be fairly easy to preserve, since employers have accommodated it.

A rebranded version of Obamas law may well cover fewer people. But its GOP advocates believe most Americans will find their goal of universal access to care politically acceptable when measured against the Democratic ideal of universal coverage, underwritten by government.

Many GOP allies in the business community favor revising the ACA. That includes major players among hospitals, insurers and pharmaceuticals.

Trump may have given this group some cover by saying that he wants to keep parts of the law, but his bottom line remains unknown.

Budget hawks

 For budget hawks, unwinding the Obama health law is a beginning. Next they could move on to much bigger objectives like restructuring Medicaid and Medicare, and placing a cost-conscious limit on tax breaks for employer coverage.

Budget hawks see health care as the main driver of government deficits, and they are loath to address that imbalance by raising taxes. Instead they want to rewrite the social compact so individuals accept more responsibility and risk for their health care.

House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is the most prominent member of this camp, and his Better Way agenda is its roadmap. Georgia Rep. Tom Price, Trumps nominee for Health and Human Services, is a budget hawk. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has been in the same orbit throughout his career.

The problem for budget hawks is that the 2016 political campaign did not give them a mandate. Issues like Medicare and Medicaid were scarcely discussed. Trump said he wouldnt cut Medicare, and sent conflicting signals on Medicaid.

Many Democrats cant wait for Republicans to follow the call of the budget hawks. Betting that will backfire, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is rallying her lawmakers against attacks on the ACA and Medicare.

The rip-it-up society

 The most conservative lawmakers want to pull Obamacare up by the roots as if it never existed, says Republican political consultant Frank Luntz. That sentiment is embodied by the 40 or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, and its probably broadly shared among conservatives.

Some do not believe the federal government should be involved in health care, and they couldnt care less about replacing the ACA.

They would say that Obamas plan has failed, said Luntz.

GOP leaders may need these lawmakers to advance on replacement legislation; coaxing them to a middle ground might not be possible.

Trump calls the ACA a disaster, and thats pleasing to those farthest on the right. Its unclear if hed walk their walk.

Pragmatists 

At the core of this small group are legislative veterans who understand the excruciating difficulties of getting major bills to a presidents desk. GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine are pragmatists.

They may find support from Republican governors who expanded Medicaid under the health law. GOP congressional leaders could gravitate to this camp.

The biggest challenge for pragmatists will be to win over some Democrats for replacement legislation. While repealing most of Obamacare is possible with a simple majority in the Senate, 60 votes would probably be needed for a replacement. There will only be 52 GOP senators next year.

Republicans need a fancy Rose Garden repeal ceremony...and I expect them to have one, said Dan Mendelson, CEO of the consulting firm Avalere Health. On the other hand, theres 20 million people with health insurance under the ACA, and they dont want to dump them. Theres no clear path for how to square that conflict.",R

But he also denied TheDCNFs request to depose State Department officials.  101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.\n\nHuma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I dont look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail guess we just arent the right people.\n\nJudge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said Judge Leons Order made clear his frustration with the State Departments continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure. I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. Its getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is corruption.\n\nState Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the courses were not completed by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh. Thats for peons, not the elite evidently.""",F

b'Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And',"b'5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nPresident Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.\n\nDuring his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.\n\nObama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope hes enjoying that Gilligans Island by himself.\n\nHow ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. Its like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.\n\nWatch President Obamas full speech here,'",F
b'Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N.  US Herald',"b'Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""\n\nSeeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.\n\nThe Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.\n\n""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.\n\nPresident Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""\n\nHe mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where theres no ultimate military victory to be won.""\n\nInstead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""\n\nWhich may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most \'reasonable\' people to try to deal with.\n\nIt\'s likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.\n\nIt\'s this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get\'s us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.\n\nIt\'s about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We\'re past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone\'s feelings. If we don\'t take action soon, then Obama\'s pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.\n\nMake sure to share this on Facebook if you think it\'s time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.\n\nSource: Conservative Tribune'",F

"b'If You Cant Run Your Own House, You Certainly Cant Run the White House  Eagle Rising'","b'A Daisy of a Rerun\n\nI am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.\n\nThe year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson approved that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly war mongering opponent, Barry Goldwater.\n\nToday, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnsons deceitful war policies, Goldwaters vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nations media.\n\nI mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.\n\nObviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a Daisy remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.\n\nSomehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwaters 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.\n\nInstead, todays voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as news and views. With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the medias reaction of ridicule was to be expected.\n\nNow, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Teds dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party. This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a pathological liar and utterly amoral.\n\nAs the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of Lyin Ted, insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination. These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.\n\nSchools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?\n\nAnother safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say derogatory when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the liberal press moniker has now everyday acceptance.\n\nIt is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the publics re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.\n\nAlso, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and rsums of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.\n\nThese quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.\n\nWith that, consider the Presidents past considerations of todays democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary cant be trusted and isnt qualified to be President.\n\nObviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, its damning, given the time frame.\n\nAlso during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: If you cant run your own house, you certainly cant run the White House.\n\nApparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.\n\nAgain, wouldnt it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",F
"b'HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is'","b'775 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nCNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trumps tax returns as well as other things.\n\nLook at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.\n\n521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clintons win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.\n\nRegardless of these apparent winning results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clintons infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.\n\nWith the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Lets not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clintons campaign. We all must wait and see.'",F

Its a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putins trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.\n\nPutin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.\n\nSo remember  dont trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was.

And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clintons left hand.\n\nI further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.\n\nFurther rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesnt appear to want to be president any longer.\n\nNo matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.\n\nAs for Hillary Clintons health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill.

b'Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed Watered-Down AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa  Eagle Rising',"b'Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe congressional report, titled,The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story, was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.\n\nThe congressional report focused on Clintons decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.\n\nIt also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.\n\nRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.\n\nThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nations largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company, said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\nWhen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDAs approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe, said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, alleged due to the companys diluted drugs, it subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality, according to the report.\n\nThe question becomes, how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise, asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obamas first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundations vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the watered-down drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered more than $1.8 million packages.\n\nSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections, Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the companys anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\nThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize, he said.\n\nRanbaxys first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public warning letter to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the companys quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, show much lower potencies in these batches.\n\nAlthough Ranbaxys generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the companys HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said hes now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on access to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. I have tried to reach out to them, he told TheDCNF. But I havent had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was deeply suspect.\n\nIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called CHAI was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation, Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, relaxed intellectual property policy standards, promising the U.S. government would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any Sub-Saharan country relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies, the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAIs endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS relief  a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clintons endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become good acquisition targets, according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years, the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the false hopes offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\nYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients.

b'DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS  Freedom Daily',"b'5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nJason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, its one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.\n\nThis is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton EVER.\n\nFrom Bearing Arms:\n\nWe told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didnt tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.\n\nFalconers Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.\n\nThe 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconers to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.\n\nClinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers immunity. Its an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.\n\nJason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.'",F

This proves that they dont know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldnt be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.\n\nIf I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then Id probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that theyd be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community.

They call white people racist just because theyre white. They attack people just because theyre white.\n\nThey call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They cant. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.\n\nI judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.\n\nBased off what Ive seen so far, I can proudly say F*ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in on.'",F

"b'New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""'","b'71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nNew Jerseys despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the Bridgegate scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:\n\nThe decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.\n\nChris Christie is also Republican Presidentials nominee Donald Trumps transition team chairperson.\n\nJust four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the worlds busiest bridges.\n\nGovernor Christie was Trumps most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major conservative Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trumps benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.\n\nFamously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. Its have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governors the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.\n\nLast week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.\n\nThe Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administrations bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this years Republican Presidential campaign.\n\nWatch his shame:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

b'How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary  Eagle Rising',"b'In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a powerful hate group, has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.\n\n[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: Americas Most Powerful HATE Group\n\nAs a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this authors contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get Hillary the Horrible into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.\n\nA proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone  especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President  to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.\n\nThe proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters  but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens  to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.\n\nDue to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.\n\nDonald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, Americas most powerful Hate Group, not only wants Hillary the Horrible to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.\n\nLet us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",F

Anything with Clinton in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed watered-down HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this the question is, did the Clintons know about it. Im betting that they did.\n\nRanbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.\n\nThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nations largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company, said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story, was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.  101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clintons decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe question becomes, how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise, asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.\n\nThis could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundations aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the watered-down drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered more than $1.8 million packages. Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections, Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.\n\nRanbaxys generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clintons charity have not severed ties with them either.\n\nCompanies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they dont like.\n\n\n\nRight now, the Obama administrations proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and its one that many Americans dont know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before its too late!\n\n\n\n\n\nSEE MORE HERE:\n\nDont Let Obama Give Away the Internet | Ted Cruz | U.S. Senator for Texas'",F
b'Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination',"b'13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nS Trumps number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the companys hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.\n\nSources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendments protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trumps campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion, the lawsuit says.\n\nIronically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominees most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiels parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now hes supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.\n\nThiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogans secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaires then-secret sexual orientation.\n\nBut now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOPs bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, Every American has a unique identity. Im proud to be gay, Im proud to be a Republican, after a lengthy rant against government incompetence. He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.\n\nUnfortunately, his own party didnt pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.\n\nFederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination, said the Department of Labors OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. Our nations taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers. Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself vigorously and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.\n\nNow, the executive who accused his employer  the federal government  of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his companys hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!'",F

In fact, it is one of his lifes purposes to serve and help his brothers and sisters in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.\n\nOn the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.\n\nFor this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faithhe learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.\n\nHe has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.\n\nIn terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third, Wilson concluded. I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You dont stress out about much.\n\nIts a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.\n\nGood mens hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.\n\nEspecially now in Obamas America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in thereif you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share corruption can and will take root.\n\nSo the NFL told him not to talk about his faith\n\nInteresting how things seem so one sided right? Dont talk about God, it hurts peoples feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and its heroes.\n\nWith this kind of garbage happeningthe truth becomes that much more obvious.\n\nWords like tolerance are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.\n\nAsk yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?\n\nThere is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.\n\nand Obamas Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.'",F
b'Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake',"b'Germanys chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.\n\nThis quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.\n\nThe German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkels conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.\n\nMerkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a living lie.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail,\n\nSpeaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, we can do this, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany, she said. The leader, once known as the Iron Chancellor, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees, she told the conference in Karlsruhe. With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.\n\nHere she is, saying that multiculturalism is a living lie. Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, its not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if theyre not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.\n\nBeware, America.

b'Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!',"b'Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.\n\nWell, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed watered down drugs to third-world countries.\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.  The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.  The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign.  The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundations vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the watered-down drugs.\n\nThis latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!\n\nDo you think that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world?

b'OUTRAGE! Obama Spends $770M Dollars In Tax Payer Money To Renovate Mosques Over Seas [VIDEO]',"b""OUTRAGE! Obama Spends $770M Dollars In Tax Payer Money To Renovate Mosques Over Seas [VIDEO]\n\nCBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and hes still doing it. Hes diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran why he gives ISIS a pass why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.\n\nSet aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office its where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques we are funding their wars as well, even against America.\n\nFrom TruthFeed:\n\nYou Didnt Build ThatOh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas  outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid.  101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States investment of millions to refurbish mosques as a good-will effort in Muslim countries has upset many. We are spending money we dont have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now, said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.\n\nMany of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We cant make ends meet and our country cant pay its bills yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.\n\nThe State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas  something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders. What bovine excrement.\n\nLet me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic. This is a coup from without and from within the enemy is now among us.""",F
b'Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to Salaries and Other Expenses  Eagle Rising',"b'Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation  where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners  the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed good that the foundation has done over the years.\n\nI dont think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that theyre an organization for good.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:\n\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundations massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organizations IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and other expenses. The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organizations IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as other expenses, while the remaining almost $851K was marked as professional fundraising expenses. Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more other expenses in 2014.\n\nSometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",F

Spreading rumors is an example of terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue, he said. This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.

After all, Fox spreads little but fear and thats what has given us Donald Trump.\n\nCrime in the nation is down. An Americans odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:\n\nFear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant.

Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasnt to any stranger this time it was to his wife.\n\nHe had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.\n\nThe story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims arent supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.\n\nThank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a disobedient woman. Especially when pregnant.\n\nQuran 4:34  So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husbands] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance  [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.\n\nJust in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of beat them, the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.\n\nI wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims which he is following.'",F
b'A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD  Eagle Rising',"b'After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughters apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clintons apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.\n\nThe different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.\n\nAside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillarys stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.\n\nSince the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.\n\nThe question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?\n\nWhat we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.\n\nIt is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.\n\nIf anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.\n\nThe American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President.

b'UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today!  Freedom Daily',"b'978 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nI dont recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clintons health constantly making headline, but its also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from the poll:\n\nMore than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either below average or very poor health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. Thats a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.\n\nThe share of voters who think Clintons health is average remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either above average or excellent health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).\n\nVoters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clintons potential medical issues.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, shes one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually looking old or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I cant see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillarys health. The suspicion isnt from one particular thing, its from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.\n\nAt one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other maladys. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinsons, Alzheimers, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting confused and needing naps, of which she was probably severely punished.\n\nAnd then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldnt mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.\n\n\n\nAnother of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.\n\n\n\nThen there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someones arm.\n\n\n\nHeres an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter dont see her in person because she looks awful.\n\n\n\nAnd of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives shes gasping for air. Its incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack  *GASP excuse me, President of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'",F
b'Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania',"b'Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.\n\nFirst proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.\n\nIn other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.\n\nAs Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.\n\nTheres actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they wont know the law, and theyll be engaging in discriminatory challenges, Gitlin said. That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.\n\nAs we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.\n\nAnd thats exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.\n\nWere going to watch Pennsylvania, Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people dont come in and vote five times. If you do that, were not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion  I really mean this, Pennsylvania  is if cheating goes on.\n\nTrump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!\n\nIn response to Trumps claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.\n\nWith the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trumps favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.\n\nFeatured Image: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images'",F
"b'We Dont Adapt To Your Culture, You Adapt To Ours'","b'America needs to get with the program when it comes to immigration. Yes, we are a nation of immigrants, the proverbial melting pot.

If they want to stick with their own programs then they should have stayed put in their countries of origin.\n\n(Via JewsNews) Quebec mayor gives Muslim refugees a little piece of his mind by spilling the truth that Canadians dont adapt to them, its the other way around.\n\n MUSLIMS MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST ADAPT TO CANADA, ITS CUSTOMS, ITS TRADITIONS, ITS WAY OF LIFE, BECAUSE IT WAS THE COUNTRY THAT WAS CHOSEN TO EMIGRATE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA. NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE FOR THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE, NOT THE CANADIANS WHO SO GENEROUSLY WELCOMED THEM. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CANADIANS ARE NOT RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC. WE ACCEPT MANY IMMIGRANTS, IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS, CONTRADICTING TO MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT ACCEPT IMMIGRANTS NON-MUSLIMS. FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE. THE MUNICIPALITY OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW. FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.\n\nIt boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.\n\nWhile most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isnt waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System\n\nBecause Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or dont. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.\n\nIntegrate or Vacate, but dont try to change us. You will fail.'",F

The booklet, which was distributed to business colleagues in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel.

b'Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISISThen This Video Shows Up',"b'It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadnt been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but hed made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.\r\n\r\nFirst, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasnt long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldnt. He peeked into peoples desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?\r\n\r\nIt wasnt until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music  the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans  and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what theyd seen. (Hey, bro, its the president! Yeah, bro!) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word ISIS came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. Hed just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.\r\n\r\nAt first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasnt kidding. I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group, hed tell them. Theyd laugh and say something like, Hey, Mr. President, please dont ever say that again publicly! Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.\r\n\r\nThey were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each others eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, Is it about how youre really a terrorist? He looked at her and said, Yes, actually. She stopped eating her Popsicle. Donald Trump was right about you? He nodded. About everything.\r\n\r\nHe explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. Hed made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.\r\n\r\nIsnt that the plot of the first season of Homeland? Hillary asked. Obama nodded. Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.\r\n\r\nNo one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didnt know what had given it away. Hed been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? Wait, what? Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bos eyes were really tiny LED screens. Did you know that when Bo barks, Obama said, hes just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?\r\n\r\nHillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. Youre a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America? Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, I feel like Im short-circuiting! Obama did his best to comfort her. Bo does that sometimes. Then hell go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.\r\n\r\nHillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raismans floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. Im sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand, Hillary apologized. Do you mean a fin? Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: But I havent even told you the best part yet. Im going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.\r\n\r\nIsis?\r\n\r\nNo, ISIS. All caps.\r\n\r\nHillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didnt want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought hed be. He told her like for real they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nHe was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, Well wait until Im president, and then we will secretly destroy America together. Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldnt stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to Wonderwall as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair. Pretty soon, it was morning again.'",F
b'Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context',"b'I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:\n\nBill Clinton: Natural For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors\n\nHeres Google:\n\nNaturally, my reaction was oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wifes campaign now?\n\nOf course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people dont do, to find out the real story  and the real story is that there is no pay to play.\n\nIt was natural for people whove been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldnt do anything they shouldnt do, Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN\n\nIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesnt mean theyll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but theres no evidence they got them.\n\nNow, lets talk about the foundation the media doesnt like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasnt given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trumps charitable foundation over concerns that it engaged in some impropriety as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others contributions to make them appear to have come from him although he hasnt given to the foundation since 2008. Source: Media Matters\n\nMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clintons candidacy:\n\nJournalists have been criticized for the double standard in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clintons pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Posts reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trumps Dr. Oz stunt.\n\nAll of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton scandal (if you call getting sick a scandal) while ignoring every scandal in Trumps closet, and trust me, there are a lot.\n\nFeatured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.'",F
b'Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning',"b'Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.\r\n\r\nLast year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we\'re drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015\r\n\r\nThe story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.\r\n\r\nAccording to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico\'s ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump\'s statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump\'s 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.\r\n\r\nSo, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump\'s CNN debate.\r\n\r\nSo, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump\'s habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you\'re going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump\'s lies.'",F

She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,\n\nIf I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.\n\nThese comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlins Sunday elections. She also said,\n\nIf I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.\n\nShe took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.\n\nThe results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.\n\nRegardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.\n\nHowever, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.\n\nMerkel stated,\n\nIf people dont want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germanys. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.\n\nChristian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,\n\nIt is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.\n\nThe growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it aint broke dont fix it.\n\nThis could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obamas and Hillary Clintons. She is no different which is why many Americans too cannot stand her.'",F
b'Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM!  Freedom Daily',"b'20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWhat do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.\n\nThe other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.\n\nTim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernicks protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.\n\nTebow is known for his religious antics, Tebowing celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.\n\nHis comments about Kaepernick were as follows\n\nWhen people have belief in something, said Tebow, or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and its all about standing for it the right way.\n\nKeyword is STANDING which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. Hes a high paid bench player and hes being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.\n\nIf he wants to protest, thats cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonalds next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.\n\nAnd lets not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.\n\nClaiming youre oppressed is really you admitting youre lazy and dont want to work for anything.\n\nHow did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasnt oppressed.\n\nName one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.\n\nI can tell you what they can do to better themselves.\n\nI can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.\n\nIf anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.\n\nTim Tebow was short on words because hes smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. Hes too busy working on his career path.\n\nGood for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!\n\nScrew Kaepernick.'",F
b'Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed',"b'When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know whats going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.\n\nOh how wrong they were, and still are.\n\nFirst off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isnt a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking theyll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.\n\nThe insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.\n\nDemocrats think the world will agree with them, and theyre flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:\n\nA new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.\n\nSo Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says America first its suddenly racist.\n\nOk, yeah, that sounds logical.\n\nSixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. Floored by the results, the pollster laments that the basket of deplorables, who he previously thought were just a marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia, is too big to ignore. He writes: This not a basket of deplorables who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or other but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.\n\nDo you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You dont call them deplorables, you recognize that half the country is against you. Lets get this done in November.\n\n(Source: Breitbart)\n\n\n\n'",F

We dont need their oil we would make do. The majority of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, as does the Bin Laden family. The Saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in June the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clintons campaign. Shes taking money from a stone cold enemy and thats not the only one by any means. You do not consort or take money from those who intend to destroy your country period. That goes for Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. It also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. We never learn our lesson, do we?\n\nNow it comes to light that Saudi Arabia is selling ISIS sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis and WESTERNERS all bought slaves at the auction. This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?\n\nFrom Jihad Watch:\n\nIt isnt news that the Islamic State has long been abusing and trafficking sex slaves  especially Yazidi girls  but it has been now discovered that the sex slaves of IS are being sold in horrifying auctions to UK ally Saudi Arabia.

Western women have also been reported to be among the victims in keeping with the Islamic States practice of enslaving kafir women: The Islamic States human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be kafir, non-Muslim people like Yazidis and Christians, before selling them for money. The depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin.\n\nAs these women are rescued from ISIS, they are not being given freedom. They are being sold on the auction block into a hellish existence. These are the people that Hillary Clinton takes money from, makes deals with and hobnobs with. Monsters of a feather.\n\nI have said for a long time, not only are the Saudis sponsoring ISIS, so are the Russians. We are being played. Our own president is complicit. Lets not elect another corrupt demon who cares nothing of women and children being sold to rapists. After all, Hillary Clinton is married to one.""",F

It sounds unreal, but thats the truth in Obamas America.\n\nWere all aware of the scandal at the Veterans Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.\n\nTrump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:\n\nWe have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb, he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police. Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world, said Trump. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room.

And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.\n\nWatch below:\n\nWouldnt it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment?

b'Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way',"b'Theres already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable  except by Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:\n\nWhile on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics . Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.\n\nAfter Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:\n\nFor the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator  to call out those lies and to do that in real time.\n\nUnfortunately, with Trumps impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, its somehow up to Hillary Clinton to shine at the debate if she hopes to win. This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.\n\nHopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.\n\nIf there is one thing this election has shown us, its that journalism is dying, if not already dead.\n\nFeatured image via Sara D.

b'Trumps Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet',"b'Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. Hes suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned rapists and drug dealers from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a temporary measure. Hes even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:\n\nThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, dont kid yourself. When they say they dont care about their lives, you have to take out their families.\n\nBut hes not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donalds Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism  hes fighting the narratives of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trumps narrative is kill them all:\n\nLast weekends attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obamas watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes were in more than a fight about narratives  these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\n\nPay attention to that last bit: They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\n\nNow, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is radical Islamic terrorism, and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating terrorists?\n\nTheyre protecting each other, but theyre really doing very bad damage  they have to open up to society and report the bad ones, Trump said in March. When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and thats a big problem.\n\nIf Muslims are protecting terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trumps eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists families. How would he define terrorism?\n\nThese are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself  but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents security to see what happens to them (shortly after suggesting that Second Amendment People could deal with them. Were dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the little red button that launches our nuclear arsenal.\n\nIts also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen  one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.\n\nNormally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. Hes said it himself. Many times.\n\nIf we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation  to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if its the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.\n\nFeatured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle'",F
b'A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD  Eagle Rising',"b'After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughters apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clintons apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.\n\nThe different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.\n\nAside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillarys stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.\n\nSince the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.\n\nThe question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?\n\nWhat we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.\n\nIt is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.\n\nIf anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.\n\nThe American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",F
"b'ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs'","b'46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. Hes surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; hes being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.\n\nThroughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia he tweeted in July. Now  brace yourself, this might come as a shock  it appears hes been lying to us the whole time.\n\nAn ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has numerous ties to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars  what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate[and] be associated with Donald Trump says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.\n\nTrump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to large numbers of Russian buyers  so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as Little Moscow.\n\nThe oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.\n\nThe oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense  they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.\n\nI think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumptionThey dont read books. They dont go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as cultural ignoramusesnot interested in social justice. Sound like anyone we know?\n\nWhen the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscows annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves  and Trump himself. Well be looking at that, yeah well be looking said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.\n\nThese business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, its that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.\n\nWatch ABC News report here:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that theyre an organization for good.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:\n\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundations massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organizations IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and other expenses. The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organizations IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as other expenses, while the remaining almost $851K was marked as professional fundraising expenses. Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more other expenses in 2014.\n\nSometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money.

b'Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head',"b""7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nLast night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying  and that the shot came from law enforcement.\n\nOne key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: I didnt want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.\n\nMy friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37  Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016\n\nWe interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:\n\nI watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there.  BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016\n\nI didnt realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said lets march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said Hands Up, Dont Shoot, Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.\n\nThe protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace, Meyer told me almost breathlessly, Ive been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant hands up, dont shoot and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.\n\nAfter leaving The Epicenter, police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful  and thats when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.\n\nMeyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, oh, absolutely.\n\nFive minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.\n\nIt wasnt a gunshot, she told us. It was much louder. It wasnt a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly They just shot him and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadnt already left, exited.\n\nAt that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters.

"b'ALERT: Police Pull Over Islamic Refugee, Horrified To See What Was In The Car'","b'We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.\r\n(via Mad News World)\r\n\r\nPolice were unable to determine why the woman, described as an Islamic refugee, was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.\r\n\r\nThe plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBIs Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.\r\n\r\nThe pipeline identified in the Muslim womans plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.\r\n\r\nIt is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.\r\n\r\nA report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.\r\n\r\nJudicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.\r\n\r\nCongress should approve funding for President Trumps border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.\r\n\r\nMany of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\nIf a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.\r\n\r\nThe only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border.

b'Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes Read My Lips Look Good  Opposition Report',"b'\n\nPosted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016\n\nWeve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably read my lipsno new taxes, a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:\n\n.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekends Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO  Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016\n\nTake a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didnt promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.\n\nLets imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. Destroy doesnt leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty yeeeeehaw, the reality is that hes talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. Hes talking about profiling Muslims. Hes talking about Donald Trumps version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isnt just a Muslim, hes an\n\nThe man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isnt just a Muslim, hes an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because hes a suspect in a bombing doesnt mean hes guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked kill and not on the most wanted list. Theres nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.\n\nWhat that means is that under Trumps dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think Im being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isnt about the narrative. It isnt about prevention or education.\n\nIts about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.\n\nThe only solace we have is that what hes promising is nothing but another read my lips. Terrorism isnt something you can simply destroy just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isnt going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trumps campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.\n\nFeatured image from file'",F

Comey gave immunity to all of Hillarys top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comeys fate.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the directors fitness for office, DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills computer. The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity, he said. This was not a real investigation. This was a protected investigation designed to look like an investigation.\n\nDiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened.

b'Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency',"b'For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we dont vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.\n\nIt hasnt been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that weve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was Papa John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didnt.\n\nThis year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesnt get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carls Jr. and Hardees. Heres one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:\n\nJudging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But thats not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesnt want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:\n\nI want to try it, CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. We could have a restaurant thats focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person. With government driving up the cost of labor, its driving down the number of jobs, he says. Youre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants. This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage, says Puzder. Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job? Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nThis threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. Hes hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.\n\nPuzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.\n\nPuzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees dont see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.\n\nYou can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. Thats just the way he is: profits over people.'",F

That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.\n\nDonald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. Hes constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. Hes a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. Hes been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to relax he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.\n\nIts obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before hes set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that hes simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trumps mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together its just gibberish:\n\nFive people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016\n\nJustwhat is he talking about?

If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.\n\nTalking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged.

For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe PAC thats suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? OBrien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.

b'BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up',"b'The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clintons use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clintons top aide Huma Abedin.\r\n\r\nApparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained tens of thousands of e-mails from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillarys e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.\r\n\r\nOn July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clintons use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed dismay, and disgust with Director Comeys decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.\r\n\r\nA high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clintons] security clearance yanked.\r\nIt is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted, the senior FBI official told Fox News. We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said but we are doing nothing, which made no sense to us.Fox News\r\nUPDATE October 17, 2016:\r\nThe FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clintons private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official pressured the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clintons e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.\r\n\r\nThe FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called The Shadow Government who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for her election campaign.BBC News\r\n\r\nUPDATE October 25, 2016:\r\nAccording to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Officials wife who later investigated Hillary Clintons use of a private e-mail server.\r\n\r\nUncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta\r\nIn September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user stonetear, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clintons private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clintons private e-mail server.\r\n\r\nMr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nWikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016\r\nOn March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:\r\n\r\nFrom:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 20150304 20:41 Subject: Special Category\r\nThink we should hold emails to and from potus?

They may not care, but I seems like they will.https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545\r\nIn other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clintons communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.\r\n\r\nUPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up\r\nOn March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clintons private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Officials wife who later investigated Hillary Clintons use of a private e-mail server.\r\n\r\nFwd: POTUS on HRC emails\r\nFrom:cheryl.mills@gmail.com To: john.podesta@gmail.com Date: 20150307 21:41 Subject: Fwd: POTUS on HRC emails\r\nwe need to clean this uphe has emails from herthey do not say state.gov\r\n Forwarded message\r\nBegin forwarded message: *From:* Josh Schwerin <joshschwerin@gmail.com> *Date:* March 7, 2015 at 6:33:44 PM EST *To:* Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>, Kristina Schake < kristinakschake@gmail.com>, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>, Jesse Ferguson <jfferg@gmail.com> *Subject:* *POTUS on HRC emails*\r\nhttps://twitter.com/katherinemiller/status/574350749280432129/photo/1 Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news.https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31077#efmAABABT\r\nUPDATE October 20, 2016: Podesta E-mails Release 13 Confirms President Obama Knew Of Clintons Private E-mail Server\r\nOn Mar 8, 2015, at 7:56 AM, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>> wrote:\r\nThey know POTUS and HRC emailed. Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm.

But its not unreasonable to assume that Josh is going to get asked how this was possible, and he should have the factset. Especially if its some weird technical thing with the Presidents email setup that he doesnt see addresses.https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/21779\r\nTo make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.\r\n\r\nI know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and arent satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing Ive either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc.https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099\r\nThe reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.\r\n\r\nHowever, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.\r\n\r\nThis suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the Presidents communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.\r\n\r\nTimeline of Events:\r\nMarch 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal e-mail account while Secretary of State.\r\nMarch 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring preservation of all e-mails.\r\nMarch 7, 2015: Barack Obama states he only learned about the private e-mail server through news reports at the same time as everybody.\r\nMarch 7, 2015: 15:41:16 -0800 (PST) Cheryl Mills writes EMAIL ID 31077 as revealed by Podesta Emails Part 18: we need to clean this uphe has emails from herthey do not say state.gov.\r\nMarch 7, 2015: Hillary Surrogate Terry McCauliffe met with the FBI agent who oversaw the Clinton e-mail case and his wife and promised financial support ($500k+) if she ran for office.Wall Street Journal\r\nMarch, 2531, 2015: Paul Cobetta, a Platte River Networks employee, permanently and irreversibly deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit likely under orders from Cheryl Mills after receiving advice on Reddit on how to delete e-mails for a VIP.

b'Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence  US Herald',"b'With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes weve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.\n\nSpeaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it\'s incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""\n\nHowever the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the presidents astounding incompetence, theres also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.\n\nThe General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""\n\nThe Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component. Investment in modernization is down by 25%, Odierno said, sidelining ""much-needed"" infantry fighting vehicle modernization and a scout helicopter development program.'",F

Hillary didnt appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!\n\nThe latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her earis that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?\n\nTwitter may have figured out the answerdo you see it?\n\nIt certainly wouldnt be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a Cough prevention machine in her hideous feminist pantsuit?\n\nHillary Clintons campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.\n\n 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

b'Why is it RACIST to Question Someones Birth Certificate?  Eagle Rising',"b'The Democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly. If you question the veracity of a black presidents birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News. Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur?\n\nFirst of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didnt exist when it was issued. Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification. Has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented? No, only a cry of racism when the request is made. They cant produce an original document and they then rely on the smear of birther and racism to substantiate that which they can produce no physical evidence of.

b'Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton?  Eagle Rising',"b'I cant wait for Weekend at Chelseas to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clintons slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups  these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low  would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a minor setback to her inevitable victory.\n\nThe American people arent buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more conspiracy theory dismissals. Mrs. Clintons mild cold, er, seasonal allergies, I mean heat exhaustion, that is to say minor case of pneumonia is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a mystery man who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable episodes (or otherwise freezes up with a brain short-circuit during a speech).\n\nThis guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.\n\nBlue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinsons disease  a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has pneumonia required a neurological squeeze test?).\n\nThe Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They wont, but they should. I wonder what official diagnosis well get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though theyve been there a hundred times before. Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clintons sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she powered through yesterday going door-to-door.\n\nThe point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. Shes proven, yet again, that she cant be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. Shes a liar. Thats her default mode. Shes corrupt. And shes sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else  including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.\n\nDo I take joy in Mrs. Clintons sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice (Proverbs 24:17).\n\nIndeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trumps supporters as a racist and irredeemable basket of deplorables, has only served to accelerate the plunge.\n\nPerhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement  especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her friend and mentor. Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags  the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.\n\nWhos the racist?\n\nIm praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You cant help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.\n\nIts almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything shes ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS shes put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, Many are the plans in a persons heart, but it is the LORDs purpose that prevails.\n\nAm I saying theres no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, theres always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.\n\nStill, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clintons political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector  a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.\n\nWhen they visit her in prison.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",F

Peter Allan said. I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.\r\n\r\nNo matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their religion of peace, right?\r\n\r\nWrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.\r\n\r\nMany American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting societys moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot co-exist  which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.'",F

Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.\n\nWould you believe that the man behind Saturdays NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of Islamophobia? This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.\n\nThe journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and heres what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):\n\nThe prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and selective enforcement based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with baseless tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: Muslims dont belong here. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.\n\nNo, youre not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.\n\nMayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion, Bollwage said, adding, It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.\n\nRahamis family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you cant beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.\n\nWelcome to Obamas America  where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!\n\nHow insane is this?

b'Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony',"b'11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nDuring a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because he wouldve gotten it, if I wanted it. But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul  this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:\n\nOne of these stories is a liea detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trumps mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesnt want to admit he lost.\n\nAssume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bushs story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallieshe had played the cash for outcomes political game for yearshe could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bushs oppositionif Trump had wanted it.\n\nThe transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush wouldve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trumps nave attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwalds point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:\n\nNow consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadnt been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simpleTrump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.\n\nWhy is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater scandal for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.\n\nRepublicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trumps other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his partys base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on its head.\n\nTrumps penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but its a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.\n\nSee for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, theres no third option here:\n\nBush: The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on somethingthat was generous and gave me moneywas Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida. Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didnt Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didnt get it, because I was opposed to Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. Im not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.\n\nTranscript of 2007 Trial Deposition:\n\nA lawyer asked Trump, Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth? Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bushand I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didnt you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didnt change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?\n\nYou be the judge of that.\n\nThe job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of all things dangerous then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. Its not possible.\n\nYou can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.\n\nAs if their job wasnt already hard enough in Obamas America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being disproportionately targeted, they can run.\n\nYes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.\n\nUp until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, thats reasonable suspicion and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate.

The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.\n\nAccording to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nObviously Obamas dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a JV team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.\n\nHowever the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.\n\nAnd the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.\n\nHowever what isnt in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.\n\nHere is a link to the Judicial Watch press release detailing the released documents.\n\nHere are the released documents themselves.'",F

I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.\n\nWhat exactly is First Lady Michelle Obamas legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous for the first time in my life Im proud of my country. I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her #BringBackOurGirls sign.\n\nBut why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?\n\n*insert mechanical applause here*\n\nBut what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?\n\nIts not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:\n\n 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now\n\nI mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?\n\nFor an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her faith and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.\n\nOf course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nBack in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work, she said. I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.\n\nThis reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the I dont like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.\n\nEither way, Im absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.""",F
"b""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona""","b'According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they dont end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.\n\nCase in point.\n\nThe specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a childs genitals, so if youre a parent of a child and youve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, youre a felon. For real.\n\nThis is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from intentionally or knowingly touching the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they dont know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.\n\nThe AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct. They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?\n\nIn others words, just trust the prosecutors, yall. Theres no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.\n\nWow.\n\nThere are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But heres an especially interesting tidbit:\n\nAs Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majoritys logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Courts help, Arizonas child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiverout of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the states residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizonas parents and caregivers.\n\nYikes.\n\nBut Im sure itll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, yall. Because doesnt government always know best?'",F

b'Public School Forced My Child To',"b'7.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nA public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.\n\nRichard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,\n\nDefendants forced Woods daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.\n\nThe Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.\n\nSpokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit says,\n\nDuring its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.\n\nClassroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim peoples faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.\n\nPart of the handout reads,\n\nNowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.\n\nIt referenced the jihad as,\n\na holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.\n\nThis reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years. Despite the fact the Thomas More Center has taken on this case neither the American Civil Liberties Union or the Freedom From Religion Foundation have weighed in on the issue.'",R
b'Trumps puzzling pitch to black voters',"b'CLEVELAND  Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of stop-and-frisk policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.\n\nIt was just another day in Trumps up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that theyve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.""\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King  who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a gladiator. King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.\n\nThe system is the problem, and hes the only gladiator that will take on the system, King said.\n\nAfter the church event, Trump sat for a town hall with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address violence in the black community, Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.\n\nWe did it in New York, it worked incredibly well, Trump said.\n\nFierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayors office.\n\nBut even before Trumps stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his ever, ever, ever remark Tuesday night.\n\nI don\'t know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it\'s ever been, Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination  when we couldn\'t take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?\n\nTrumps polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal  in the low single digits  and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks  What do you have to lose? he says  to largely white audiences.\n\nAt the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.\n\nSeated to Trumps right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (theres only one, Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (tough), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (a tough general) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (a wonderful woman), who has helped with Trumps black outreach.\n\nIm different from a lot of Republicans, frankly, Trump said from the pulpit.\n\nTrump, who has called himself the law and order candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been choking in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.\n\n""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can\'t be doing what they\'re doing, OK?\n\nKing, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.\n\nKing, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that the system had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.\n\nEvery white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump, said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.\n\nI told Michael Jackson, I said if you\'re poor, you\'re a poor Negro  I would use the N-word  but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you\'re an intellectual Negro; if you\'re a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro, King said.\n\nWhen Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, Ah, theres only one Don King.\n\nBefore King, Cohen, Trumps attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media and its casting of Trump as a racist.\n\nThe word of the 2016 election has somehow become racist, Cohen complained. Ive lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And lets not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. Its disgraceful.\n\nCohen said, Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.\n\nTrump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldnt.\n\nThey come and they take your vote, Trump said, and they say theyll see you in four years.\n\n\n\nAuthors:'",R
b'Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns',"b'11.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThe Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:\n\nDemocrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the partys nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. Were going to be here next week. Were probably going to have some downtime, Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. Theres no reason we couldnt vote.\n\nDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundations returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!\n\nBut America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romneys taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrats numerous public statements. According to The Hill:\n\nMinority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is ethically compromised and the king of the welfare kings.\n\nIronically, Romneys father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.\n\nAmerican voters deserve to know whats inside Republican nominee Donald Trumps tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clintons finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

b'Is Hillary in a No-Win Situation?',"b'Ive watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I\'ve analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, Im pretty much baffled.\n\nThe problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clintons strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknessesespecially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: Youve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then youre one of those whos created the mess were in. So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump\'s utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn\'t seem to be promising.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIndeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what Ive called political judoturning an opponents strength against her. (Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe thats why your husband\'s CIA director, and Bobby Kennedys chief speechwriter, are backing me.)\n\nFurther, there\'s a sensea highly limited sensein which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, I\'m a reasonable person who knows what\'s gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it. It\'s a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).\n\nBy contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of honest and trustworthy? If Trump can be convinced by his handlersassuming they existto avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trumpbankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold\'s expose of his charities in the Washington Postbut those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trumpand he\'s still standing.\n\nDoes any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and dont do, based on a half-century or so of history.\n\nThe Focus Is on MomentsBut Theyre Not Always The Key\n\nAsk any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:\n\nNixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter there you go again, then asked Americans are you better off? Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondales youth and inexperience. Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wifes rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.\n\nThese are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. Its why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lineszingersto win the attention and admiration of the audience. (Its also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, Youve all become theater critics.)\n\nBut in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, its the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the aha! moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obamas petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the presidents most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.\n\nThe presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a moment unlike any in debate history; thats clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: he seemed pretty reasonable or she knows what shes talking about and he doesnt. This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.\n\nThere Are Three Debates, Not OneAnd That Can Matter A Whole Lot\n\nOne key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28thbarely a week before the election.\n\nEvery other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. Thats what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; its also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.\n\nHere, I think, is an opening for Clintonespecially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a questionand they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questionsinto answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trumps astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bushs commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to arguefrom experiencethat what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting formatwith dozens of real people as participantsmakes the resort to personal insults highly risky).\n\nTrump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo\n\nThe potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.\n\nWell, he said, they\'ve got a point. I don\'t have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don\'t have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don\'t have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.\n\nJudo, however, can cut both ways. Theres a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.\n\nWell, you might be successful, Donald, but we really dont know because youre the first presidential candidate ever who wont show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, whos worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didnt start with millions from his father, says youre a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admityoure way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.\n\nDebates Are NOT Decisive\n\nOne last note. Its easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide. Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obamas clear if modest popular vote victory.\n\nIn their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other game-changers with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romneys first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the fundamentalseconomic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electoratethe stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.\n\nOf course, this cycle the fundamentals point to a very close race. So youll probably want to tune in anyway\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.'",R

Hes bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesnt read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesnt read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, cant even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.\n\nThese are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trumps own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday  but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?\n\n1. Does he actually know  or care to know  the basic information needed to competently run the country?\n\nOnly one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and thats a candidates capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump  who swooned after Clintons superb convention in Philly  has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. Hes still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.\n\nHis resurgence proves three political points  two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and  lastly, but not leastly  Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.\n\nThe first debate should be a pivot  from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isnt remotely the same thing as being ready to rule  and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably wont happen, but a boy can dream.\n\nThis is not to suggest that Trump cant do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but hes been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.\n\nTrump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs  apparently he wasnt aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates  but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trumps bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasnt aware of that fact, or just didnt care.\n\nThe caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not, said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.\n\nStone argued that Trump isnt an ignoramus  just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bushs advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bushs unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.\n\nTrumps capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless  but theres not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.\n\nMany Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUDs Section 8 program is  and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But dont people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms  by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?\n\n2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?\n\nAgain, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace  we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.\n\nThats a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with actual malice  that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\n\nDuring a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for Article 12 of the Constitution. The framers stopped at seven. He was just listing out numbers, said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.\n\nOK, lets write that one off as a gotcha  you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where some bad things are happening. The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.\n\n3. Why wont Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?\n\nHillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs  and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.\n\nBut the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.\n\nWhy does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trumps fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that hes very, very rich. He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says hes good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say hes worth less than half that much).\n\nMore serious is the issue of Trumps debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If thats a lie, theres an easy way to prove it  by releasing the returns.\n\nThis isnt a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.\n\n4. Whats the deal with his charitable foundation? Then theres the matter of Trumps sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In expos after expos, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trumps businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.\n\nThe problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.\n\n5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.\n\nBut if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements hes made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.\n\nHillary Clinton (Crooked Hillary in Trumps parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint  far from it  and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.\n\nBut its a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness  especially George W. Bushs claims about Iraq  would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trumps whoppers would take up too much space  read POLITICOs comprehensive Donald Trumps Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths for a taste.)\n\nIn an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trumps running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. Clinton, the former speaker wrote, is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing\n\nBut getting the facts right  and telling the truth  is a big thing. Its the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.\n\nAuthors:""",R
b'U.S. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants',"b'The Department of Homeland Security\'s inspector general said that 858 people who were ordered to be deported or removed instead eventually received citizenship. | AP Photo U.S. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants\n\nAt least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Securitys inspector general announced Monday.\n\nThe mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBIs fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Securitys office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Securitys records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBIs records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.\n\nThe inspector general\'s report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.\n\n""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.""\n\nIn at least three cases, the inspector generals office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels. The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.\n\nThis situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud, Inspector General John Roth said. To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.\n\nAuthors:'",R

Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. Thats not a protest; its a riot. And it doesnt endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesnt fix anything.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. Its shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.""",R
"b'Obama To UN: Giving Up Liberty, Enhances Security In America [VIDEO]'","b""Obama To UN: Giving Up Liberty, Enhances Security In America [VIDEO]\n\nFreedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure  they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They cant ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising.

How this will make the country safer, he didnt explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees, Obama said.\n\nObama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer  its made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.\n\nHow allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because its a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesnt make us safer, either.

Early on, Cruz speculated that Trumps tax returns could show a mob connection\n\nIn February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadnt released his tax returns in an interview on NBCs Meet the Press, suggesting that they might show Donald\'s business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.\n\nThe fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that theres a bombshell there, Cruz said. Its natural to wonder, Well, what is it that he\'s hiding in his taxes?\n\n2. In March, Cruz called him a sniveling coward\n\nSpeaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to spill the beans on the senators wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, Donald, youre a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.\n\nIts not easy to tick me off. I dont get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, thatll do it every time, Cruz said.\n\n3. He also called Trump a big, loud New York bully\n\nLet me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds, Cruz said . It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.\n\n4.

Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, lets be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.\n\n6. He also called him a pathological liar who lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth\n\nAlso in Indiana, on the same day the state\'s voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : Im gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesnt know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.\n\n7. And Cruz was specific with the term pathological: Trump is utterly amoral, he said\n\nI say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and hed pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie hes telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral, Cruz said .\n\n8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a serial philanderer\n\nContinuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I dont think this countrys ever seen.

But were also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.\n\nTrumps already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.\n\nAnd the result: Trumps doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obamas team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.\n\nThough only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the presidents great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obamas legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.\n\nI dont think he thinks its his legacy, I dont think any of us think its his legacy, said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.\n\nBut they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obamas America.\n\nI think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact hes had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting, said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. Hes made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.\n\nFor any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, Trump has shattered that, Vietor said. He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesnt matter if its a low blow, it doesnt matter if its not of substance. Thats a bad lesson for people to learn.\n\nAccording to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that hed had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that its not going away, despite their confidence in Clintons chances.\n\nIm not saying wed all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts, said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.\n\nNot everyones inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.\n\nHe's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure, said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.\n\nAnd Democrats sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy thats gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.\n\nThe eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement, said Earnest, is intellectually bankruptor about something other than the economy.\n\nBut that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.\n\nId rather live in a world where the two parties really compete, Papa said, than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.\n\nAuthors:""",R
"b""Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable'""","b'(CNN) Hillary Clinton\'s campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\n""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN\'s Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn\'t exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""\n\n""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""\n\nClinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.\n\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.\n\nMook said the other part of Clinton\'s plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.\n\n""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.\n\nClinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday\'s ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.\n\n""What she\'s saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that\'s a problem.""\n\nClinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better.""\n\n""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?""\n\n""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable.""\n\nClinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""\n\nAnother unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2016\n\nIn response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.\n\nDanny C.

b'Donna Brazile slams Trump for not apologizing for birther claims',"b""Donna Brazile said Trumps hectoring of Americas first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nations painful past. | AP Photo Donna Brazile slams Trump for not apologizing for birther claims\n\nDemocratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trumps refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called birther movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a wound that won't heal.\n\nRecalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own familys history, Brazile said Trumps hectoring of Americas first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nations painful past.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDonald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers, she told CNNs New Day Tuesday morning. To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.\n\nThe issue of Trumps support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday nights presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].\n\nBrazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate. It's amazing.\n\nI think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. Its the wound that won't heal, she said. And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.\n\nAuthors:""",R
b'More Milestone Moments for Donald Trump!  Eagle Rising',"b'Last week I wrote an article titled Donald Trumps Amazing Week which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and Never Trumpers everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.\n\nThe latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the toss up state category.\n\nDonald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trumps childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plans offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parents expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trumps childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parents decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.\n\nDonald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New Yorks most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trumps excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trumps unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clintons health following her fainting at last weeks September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trumps health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clintons health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.\n\nTrump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something unpresidential. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could mess up his hair. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said yes to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the Trump Train. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, its another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.\n\nNow if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed two years early and under budget, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the birther issue. Trump took the microphone and said Not to mention her in the same breath, (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it, he said. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again. Trump said.\n\nOnce again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another amazing week.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",R
b'KISS Bassist Gene Simmons on How to Stop Islamic Terrorism',"b'[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebodys girlfriend.  Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami\n\nHall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years hes been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.\n\nSimmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, should go to jail and be somebodys girlfriend. Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.\n\nNobody says the word profile. Everyone needs to get smart. Im ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if Im clear, then profile someone else. Its emergency powers during war. Theres a war going on.\n\nBut what about the people who were being unfairly profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. It is unfair. Thats why the words too bad exists.\n\nBOOM.\n\nThank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President hell consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, cant I?\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",R
b'Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff',"b'Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.\n\nClarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.\n\nBut while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.\n\nTerrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. [] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.\n\nInmates at the jail say the water in Thomas jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the mans life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.\n\nClarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.\n\nThe Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.\n\nFeatured image via Flickr'",R
"b""10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's First Debate""","b'Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.\n\nThe two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.\n\nHere are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:\n\n1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.\n\nWhen Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, How are you, Donald? Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.\n\nShortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It\'s very important to me.\n\nHe seemed to be referring to his addressing her as Secretary Clinton, although it wasnt completely clear during the moment.\n\n2. Personal Attacks Came Early\n\nClinton was first to go on the attack during tonights debate, taking aim at Trumps business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.\n\nDonald was very fortunate in his life and that\'s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we\'ll be and that everything will work out from there. I don\'t buy that. I have a different experience, Clinton said, before expanding on her fathers work as a drapery maker.\n\nTrump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in trumped up, trickle-down economics.\n\nFor one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that\'s worth many, many billions of dollars, Trump said.\n\n3. Trading Barbs Over Trade\n\nVoters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nTrump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.\n\nAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it, Trump said.\n\nClinton fired back, Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.\n\nTrump then pointed to Clintons once referring to TPP as the gold standard of trade deals.\n\nWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts, Clinton said.\n\nClinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.\n\n4. Trump Asks Why Not Blame All the Worlds Problems on Clinton\n\nLess than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I\'m going to be blamed for everything that\'s ever happened.\n\nTrump didnt miss a beat, saying to his opponent: Why not?\n\nClinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this\n\nTrump interjected: ""There\'s nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country, before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton\'s two minutes, please.""\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns\n\nTrump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.\n\nI don\'t mind releasing. I\'m under a routine audit and it will be released, he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.\n\nTrump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. I will release my tax returns against my lawyer\'s wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, he said.\n\nI think you\'ve just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns, she said. You got to ask yourself: Why won\'t he release his tax returns?\n\nMaybe he doesn\'t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he\'s paid nothing in federal taxes, she said.\n\n6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage\n\nModerator Lester Holt asked Trump what took you so long to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominees recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.\n\nAt first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obamas birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was satisfied with when Obama released his birth certificate.\n\nHolt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about its authenticity until 2015.\n\nNobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it, Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trumps decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. I figured you\'d ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.\n\nPaul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\n7. Clinton Defends Being Prepared When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail\n\nTrump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, Ive been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that\'s OK, seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonights faceoff.\n\n""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate, Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that\'s a good thing.\n\nThroughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn\'t stump as much as he does because she doesn\'t have his endurance.\n\n8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion\n\nTrumps support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.\n\nStop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact, Trump said.\n\nTrump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.\n\nThey would have won an appeal, he said, noting that there was no appeal.\n\nTrump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.\n\n9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope\n\nToward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.\n\nI did not support the war in Iraq, Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\n\nHolt corrected him, saying, The record shows otherwise.\n\nThe only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, Are you for invading Iraq?""\n\nTrump appeared to hesitate, responding, Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\n\nDespite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, The record shows that I am right.\n\n10. Sparring Over Stamina\n\nHolt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a presidential look, asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her stamina.\n\n""She doesn\'t have the look, she doesnt have the stamina, Trump said. ""I said she doesn\'t have the stamina. And I don\'t believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\n\nTrump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.\n\n""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina, Clinton said.\n\nShe also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:\n\n""One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina, Clinton said. ""But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. Who has said women don\'t deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.'",R
b'Donald Trump Jr. Just Pinned A Tweet So Stupid It Will Make Your Eyes Bleed  Opposition Report',"b'\n\nPosted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016\n\nDonald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, its a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.\n\nTogether, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe well keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.\n\nTodays silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.\n\nFor the left, its a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but lets not forget that its people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.\n\nFor years, weve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douches Twitter account this morning, I couldnt help but bust out in hysterical laughter:\n\nClearly when youre the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When liberals  otherwise known as sane people  try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, were attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. Its not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.\n\nThe Supreme Court has sided with those liberals every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. Ive said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and Ill say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.\n\nFeatured image by Gage Skidmore'",R

b'Details Emerge About NYC Bomb Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami',"b'As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.\n\nThe man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nA U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.\n\nFormer classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.\n\nOne of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.\n\nRahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate\'s degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nThe Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.\n\n""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He\'s always in there. He\'s a very friendly guy. That\'s what\'s so scary. It\'s hard when it\'s home.""\n\nMembers of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant\'s operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.\n\nInvestigators are poring over Rahami\'s past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nIn August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.\n\nToday Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.\n\nLate Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.\n\nA senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nABC News\' Cindy Galli, Megan Christie, Randy Kreider, Alex Hosenball and Cho Park contributed to this report.\n\n[Editor\'s Note Sept. 28, 2016: The original version of this report said that Ahmad Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000. Rahami\'s father later told ABC News, however, that his son and the family came in 1995 and that Rahami received his Green Card in 2000.]'",R

""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant \'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody.

"b'President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill, Setting Up Showdown With Congress'","b'President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims\' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.\n\nI am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism, Obama notes in the veto message.\n\nI have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families\' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.\n\nThe veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress\' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that\'s likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.\n\nSuffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president\'s high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.\n\nThe last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nIf passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.\n\nObama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of sovereign immunity, and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.\n\n""Overriding the president\'s veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.\n\n""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States\' relationship with countries around the world.""\n\nBut the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven\'t had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists.\n\nThe House and Senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. A veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the White House says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough Democrats to block the override effort.\n\nObama\'s former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.'",R

I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and its a presidential virtue, Conway told MSNBCs Morning Joe Tuesday. To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here. That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWith just minutes left in Monday nights debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. After the debate, Trump told CNN that I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it, indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clintons husband and daughter in the audience.\n\nTuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trumps attack might have been.\n\nI think he could have said what was on millions of Americans minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate whos been good to women and who hasn't?

People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.\n\nOverall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a knockout punch that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trumps campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.\n\nDonald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and thats fine, Conway said.\n\nI don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night.

b'Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works',"b'Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trumps vision.\n\nAs he made clear once again in Monday nights debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum termswhen one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBCs Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\n\nHillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at onceas she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clintons pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again, she said. Incomes went up for everybody.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. My whole life is about winning.  I always win, Trump says in explaining why hes running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric Winning the Global Competition. You dont get more zero-sum than that.\n\nDespite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum gamebut rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyones welfare at onceTrumps message has resonated in an era when its become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.\n\nThe recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.\n\nHence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think theyve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isnt a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.\n\nNo, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of winners without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagans appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.\n\nHillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description  clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially  support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.\n\n***\n\nIs either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their childrens hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.\n\nThe voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as its been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a cross of gold. Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.\n\nTrump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly havent lack for economic benefits in todays world. They arent supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.\n\nWe have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.\n\nZachary Karabell is head of global strategy at Envestnet and author of The Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World.

b'Insiders: The heat is on Hillary',"b""The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.\n\nInsiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThats according to The POLITICO Caucus  a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.\n\nShe shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review, said a Nevada Democrat  who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.\n\nThe media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump, a New Hampshire Democrat added. Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.\n\nOne Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.\n\nHillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception, said the Ohio Democrat. She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.\n\nRepublicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.\n\nSomehow she needs to reverse the trend, said an Ohio Republican. Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance  and maybe her last chance.\n\nShe has to stop [Trumps] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance, added a Virginia Republican. All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.\n\nAmong those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure  31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans  most pointed to the GOP nominees volatile personality.\n\nHillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk, said a Michigan Republican. The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.\n\nThe question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious? added a Michigan Democrat. Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?\n\nTwo other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:\n\nMost insiders expect Clinton to win the debate.\n\nMajorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.\n\nMedia look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary, said an Iowa Republican.\n\n[Clintons] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept, added a New Hampshire Democrat.\n\nBut not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton  or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.\n\nThe press wants Trump to win, said a Florida Democrat. Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.\n\nSome Republicans also claimed media bias  in the other direction.\n\nThe media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won, a Virginia Republican said. But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.\n\nInsiders think the debate will matter.\n\nAsked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.\n\nAmong Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent dont expect the debate to move the needle.\n\nTrump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does), a Michigan Democrat predicted. The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.\n\nThe numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldnt have a significant impact.\n\nTrump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered, said a New Hampshire Republican. He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.\n\nBut some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trumps momentum with a strong performance Monday night.\n\nIf she pins his ears back, [it helps her], said an Iowa Republican. If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.\n\nOther insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.\n\nWe're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments, an Iowa Republican said. Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.\n\nAdded a Florida Democrat: Does a damn thing matter this year?

b'How Can we LEAD When we Cant Even Control Our Own Cities? [VIDEO]  Eagle Rising',"b'Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Heres what he said:\n\nBefore going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times  because weve had some tough times  but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.\n\nEveryday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.\n\nWe all have to walk a mile in someone elses shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.\n\nMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the worlds leader. How can we lead when we cant even control our own cities?\n\nWe honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.\n\nEvery single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.\n\nThe people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. Its their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.\n\nThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.\n\nOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",R
"b""Donald Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests""","b'Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.\n\n""If you\'re not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you\'re watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.\n\nThe Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.\n\n""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world\'s leader. How can we lead when we can\'t even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.""\n\nHe continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.\n\n""It\'s tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always  and it will be by them  vigorously addressed.""\n\nBut aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.\n\nTrump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.\n\nDuring a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We\'re going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they\'ve ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,""\n\nMany African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.\n\nTrump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.\n\n""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well.

b'NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte  But It Wasnt To Protest The National Anthem',"b""NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte  But It Wasnt To Protest The National Anthem\n\nAs idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.\n\nRadicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind racism and violence are not of God.\n\nFrom the Independent Review Journal:\n\nBut after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people taking a knee began to circulate on social media. These people werent on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption:  101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild. And the troopers werent alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:\n\nPeople in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didnt matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.\n\nI was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Grahams ministry there they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. Im so very proud of these police officers they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.""",R

He didnt say the document was legitimate. He didnt go that route.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOf Trumps statement on Obamas birthplace, Arpaio added: It didnt bother me.\n\nArpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obamas birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.\n\nTrump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States  a claim the presidents supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.\n\nBut while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obamas birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that we are looking at a forged document.

He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing to say its a legitimate document.\n\nArpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the presidents birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.\n\nStill, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.\n\nI have no idea now where he was born, Arpaio said.

"b'Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say'","b'The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.\n\nJohn Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.\n\n""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.\n\nThree of the latest national polls  all conducted before the attacks this weekend  had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.\n\nIn an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump\'s 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump\'s 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.\n\nA CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump\'s 45 percent.\n\nThe split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump\'s 47 percent.\n\n""Traditionally, it\'s been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that\'s kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.\n\nAndres Kudacki/AP Photo\n\nCurrent events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.\n\nHe said Trump\'s rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS\'] behalf.""\n\nJames Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.\n\n""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.\n\n""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.'",R
b'Everything you need to know about Trump and Clintons first 2016 presidential debate',"b'Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderatorfor the first debate. | Getty Everything you need to know about Trump and Clintons first 2016 presidential debate\n\nWhen is the first general election presidential debate?\n\nThe first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat time is the debate and how long is it?\n\nThe debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks.\n\nHow can I watch the debate?\n\nIt will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN.\n\nWho will participate in the debate?\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified.\n\nWho will moderate the debate?\n\nLester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. Its his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.\n\nWhat is the format of the debate?\n\nThe debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: America\'s direction, achieving prosperity, and securing America. The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.\n\nWhy aren\'t Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?\n\nLibertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.\n\nWhat\'s at stake for Hillary Clinton?\n\nThe debate is Clintons chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clintons camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trumps weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.\n\nWhat\'s at stake for Donald Trump?\n\nTrump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint  provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected  could help him clear the low bar again.\n\nWhat is the most watched debate in presidential history?\n\nIn 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.\n\nWhat\'s the most-watched television moment of all time?\n\nSuper Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.\n\nStill, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.\n\nAuthors:'",R

They didn\'t ask her about, you know, much, Trump said on Fox Newss Fox and Friends. But I was asked about my tax returns, which I\'ve told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did  I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStill, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said went really well despite some hostile questions. The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trumps real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.\n\nI didnt think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that, Trump said. That\'s a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say its older because then youll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say Wow I didnt know Trump was that old. Hey, shell be unimpressed.\n\nWell, he didn\'t ask her about the emails at all. He didn\'t ask her about her scandals. He didn\'t ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed, he said. He didn\'t ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there\'s no question about it. He didn\'t ask about her foundation.\n\nAttacking Holt became a running theme from Trump\'s campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.\n\n""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clintons candidacy  the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya  that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.\n\nTrump\'s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.\n\nI just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who\'s a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it\'s a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.""\n\nWhile the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.\n\nI had a problem with a microphone that didn\'t work. I dont know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose, he said. My microphone, in the room they couldn\'t hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn\'t exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.\n\nAsked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called Miss Piggy and Miss Housekeeping because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November.""\n\nI know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe, he said. She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn\'t quite that way, but that\'s okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.\n\nAuthors:'",R
b'Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground',"b'Donald Trump\'s reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.\n\nTrump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.\n\nHe called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O\'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.\n\nRousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate\'s exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.\n\nTrump\'s surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.\n\nNewt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn\'t do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.\n\nThese sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.\n\nTrump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought  especially since Trump made Clinton\'s eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.\n\n""It\'s been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.\n\nTrump\'s recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings.\n\nThe Washington Post\'s Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that\'s the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.\n\nTrump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate\'s muddled stance on immigration, The Post\'s Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn\'t go very well"" for Trump.\n\n""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it\'s best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd  or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier  and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the \'Fox & Friends\' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards.\n\nTrump\'s last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.\n\nRelated: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster""\n\nThe candidate\'s last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.\n\nTrump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.\n\nTV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.\n\nThis accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.\n\n""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday\'s ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.""\n\nDiamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.""\n\nTrump\'s campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump\'s position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""\n\n""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn\'t need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.""\n\nThis conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump\'s critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.\n\nTrump\'s relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.\n\nAccording to TVNewser, Wednesday\'s town hall will focus on ""issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans this election cycle.""\n\nAccording to Nielsen data, only 1.5% of Hannity\'s 2 million nightly viewers are African American. Overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of Fox News viewers are African American.'",R

Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.\n\nDavid Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie\'s former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie\'s reelection campaign.\n\nWildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.\n\nWildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone.""\n\nOn August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""\n\n""Got it,"" Wildstein responded.\n\nA phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.\n\n""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.\n\nWildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.\n\nWildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni\'s office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.\n\nThis ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.\n\nWildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.\n\nBaroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein\'s testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.\n\nWildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.\n\nOn Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.\n\nBob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess.""\n\nWildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.\n\n""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni\'s office.\n\nWildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns.\n\nWildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie.\n\nAll of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.\n\nOn the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.\n\n""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified.\n\nA Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.\n\nWildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased.""\n\nSeveral calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned.\n\nLast week, Wildstein testified that Baroni\'s role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie\'s administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie\'s office\'s interests.\n\nWildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie\'s opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.\n\nKelly and Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with Bridgegate.

b'I Was RFKs Speechwriter. Now Im Voting for Trump. Heres Why.',"b'I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps.\n\nThis year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.\n\nHere it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But todays Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.\n\nNor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at regime change. She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as another Hitler. She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.\n\nIn fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that Americas natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.\n\nThat candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.\n\nIt must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putins moves in Ukraine to what Hitler didan insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin killing Russians, a doubly illegal act of war.\n\nMoreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.\n\n***\n\nJohn Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war. Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.\n\nBut within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our strategy of peace, he said, was not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our childrens future. And we are all mortal. As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, we must reexamine our own attitudeas individuals and as a nationfor our attitude is as essential as theirs.\n\nSix months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.\n\nOur brave young men, he said, are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.\n\nHe also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. All this is our responsibility, he said, not just a nations responsibility but yours and mine.\n\nJohn and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.\n\nThe legacy of JFK & RFK is being abandoned by todays Democratic Party.\n\nTheirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by todays Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.\n\nScores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see Americas unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.\n\nMost amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itselfas we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.\n\nWhere are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime existential threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be existential enemy.\n\nThere are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.\n\nSurely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.\n\nBut, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.\n\nFor the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.\n\nAnd they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.\n\n***\n\nSo my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.\n\nWe must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.\n\nPresident Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our childrens future.\n\nSecond, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.\n\nBut nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.\n\nDonald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, America first. But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.\n\nFinally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, There can be no business as usual with Russia.\n\nSurely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.\n\nAnd therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:\n\nReturn to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.\n\nDo not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.\n\nCommit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.\n\nThis, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.\n\nWell may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.\n\nFlawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.\n\nTruly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.\n\nAdam Walinsky worked in the Department of Justice during the Kennedy administration and later served as legislative assistant and speechwriter to Sen.

He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.""\n\nThe writ referred to in the federal prosecutors\' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.\n\nDefense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it\'s unclear whether he\'s been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he\'s made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.\n\nWhile Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.\n\nThe letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami\'s case, but prosecutors say that\'s ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.\n\nCourt records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami\'s arraignment or the defense lawyers\' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.\n\nJosh Gerstein is a senior reporter for POLITICO.\n\nAuthors:'",R

One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.\n\nThree other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I cant say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.\n\nFrom the Daily Mail:\n\nNational Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area  including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy  all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.\n\nA number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.\n\nOn Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan Black Lives Matter on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, Stop  thats not what this is about, as young men broke bottles in the street.\n\nAfter a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.\n\nA riot is an uncontrollable beast once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com'",R

b'How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward',"b'Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.\n\nBut lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.\n\nTrump is saying yes to Fox News almost every day but saying no to most other major networks and news organizations  a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into Fox & Friends on Monday morning, he is booked on The OReilly Factor Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidates exposure to hard-hitting questions  while fueling frustration among journalists.\n\nAt Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts wont ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isnt challenged  and thats the way he wants it.\n\nThe problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isnt reaching out.\n\nIt is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in swing districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.\n\nOn election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney landslide the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.\n\nFeatured image via Flickr'",R
b'Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity',"b'United Nations (CNN) President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence.\n\nThe President\'s interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders\' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday.\n\nAt the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump\'s call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\n""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn\'t mention Trump by name.\n\nObama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable.""\n\nJUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45\n\n""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries\' ability to take collective action.\n\n""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.""\n\nThe refugee issue is one that\'s captured the world\'s attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public\'s consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.\n\nA recent study by from the UN\'s refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.\n\nObama\'s summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments.\n\n""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed.""\n\nLeaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions.\n\n""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.\n\n""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added.\n\nThe Obama administration is hopeful the Leader\'s Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.\n\nNational Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees.\n\n""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement.\n\nBut aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.\n\n""We have to be optimistic that we\'ll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International\'s Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it\'s nowhere near what\'s actually needed.""\n\nThe US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria\'s neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.\n\nThe President\'s chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.\n\n""The President\'s commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.""\n\nVetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap.""\n\nDavid Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he\'s hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.\n\n""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven\'t, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now.""\n\nBut the co-hosts of the Leaders\' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders.\n\n""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.""\n\nAs they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who\'ve lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.\n\nPerhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.\n\nAnd protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who\'ve never known life outside of a camp.\n\n""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said.'",R

"b'Obama wears hat, breaking Politics 101 rule on headgear'","b'Obama wears hat, breaking Politics 101 rule on headgear\n\nPresident Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.\n\nThe president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat, Obama said once he took the podium.

b'Clinton vs. Trump: The debate before the debate',"b'Hillary Clintons campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday nights big debate: Dont let Donald Trump get away with it.\n\nAnd Trumps campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clintons team is just trying to game the refs.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clintons post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a dead heat.\n\nThe latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful, Silver tweeted.\n\nDuring the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clintons aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.\n\nWe are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CBS This Morning, adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, that that simply be checked.\n\nThe thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.\n\nBut Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trumps claim that Holt may be unfair to him because hes a Democrat and the system is very unfair. The NBC Nightly News anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.\n\nI dont know that he knew what Lester Holts voter registration was, said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. He didnt lie, Conway said at one point, explaining that a lie would mean that he knew the mans party registration.\n\nIn a presidential cycle thats seen endless debates about debates, Mondays theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldnt try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.\n\nBut Clintons campaign has beat up on Holts NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trumps false assertion that he didnt support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.\n\nView One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nThe nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said, Janet Brown, the commissions executive director, told CNNs Reliable Sources.\n\nWhen it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, I dont think its a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nFor her part, Clinton wont let Trumps lies go by the wayside, press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldnt, either.\n\nThere is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out, he said. Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He cant possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.\n\nI think what the concern is from both of the campaigns  and what it should be  is that the moderator is not the person whos running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer, he said. You can hold people accountable, theres no question, but I dont think its the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so theyre making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.\n\nTrumps campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camps preparation for two Trumps.\n\nWe dont want Donald Trumps lies and distortions to be a distraction. Were hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do, Mook told NBCs Today.\n\nAsked about Clintons rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just dont know that.\n\nView One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nBut Conway shot down the notion that theres any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is to become human during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that Overprogramming leads to short circuits, and Conway joined the pile-on.\n\nHes not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is, Conway said. And thats a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that havent been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.\n\nAfter Mook warned against a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy, Conway added that the two campaign managers are living in parallel universes.\n\nI mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying its your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time, she said. I\'m just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton\'s sweet spot. Yes, she\'s experienced at doing them, but the experience hasnt necessarily been beneficial.\n\nAside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clintons willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.\n\nIm worried that some of the headlines are already written, that theyre conclusions in search of evidence, Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.\n\nWhat I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter, Conway said. Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we cant get a fair shake from certain people.\n\nConway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate moguls performance.\n\nSo if she ends up saying to him, Thats just not true, youre distorting my record, youre being mean to a woman, and then people will say, He was mean to a woman, and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up  even if its not true, she said. So that would be my concern, that hes not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that shes not a great debater, that shes not really ready for tonight the way he is, that shes going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself  and not try to compete with Clinton\'s detailed policy expertise.\n\n""She\'s been in government since I was a child. I don\'t remember a time she hasn\'t been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she\'s going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he\'s going to comport himself very, very well, and he\'s going to be  he\'s just going to be like you see him on  when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone.

Ouch.)\n\nAnd while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (unemployment rate), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBIs crime statistics. The debate moderator doesnt need to serve as the Encyclopedia Britannica, he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.\n\nJournalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.\n\nIf reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with?

b'Another Terrorist Attack in NYCWhy Are we STILL Being Politically Correct  Eagle Rising',"b'On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a pressure cooker device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.\n\nGiven that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isnt that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the bad guys. Unfortunately, our leadership  who ostensibly wants to protect us  finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio  who famously ended stop-and-frisk profiling in his city  was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization, de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and  agencies are at full alert, he said. Isnt an intentional act terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James ONeill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New Yorks Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word terrorism is defined. A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism. Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his obvious assessment?\n\nThe two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that we need to do everything we can to support our first responders  also to pray for the victims and that we need to let this investigation unfold. Trump was more direct. I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows whats going on, he said. But boy we are living in a timewe better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. Its a terrible thing thats going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.\n\nUnfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as soft targets. Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",R
b'France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery',"b'\n\nPlastic glasses, knives, forks and food boxes are being been banned in France. (Bertrand Combaldieu/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS  France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.\n\nThe new law is a part of the countrys Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries  including in some U.S. states  no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as Frances will be.\n\nThe general idea behind the law  following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming  is to promote a circular economy of waste disposal, from product design to recycling, French lawmakers say.\n\n[A Maryland countys nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]\n\nObjections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.\n\nIn the words of French President Franois Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended to make France  an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.\n\nNot all share the enthusiasm of Frances Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.\n\nEamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge Frances ban.\n\nWe are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law, he said. If they dont, we will.\n\nSupporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Sgolne Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an anti-social provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.\n\nThe ban was then postponed until 2020.'",R
b'The Mystery of Trumps Man in Moscow: Carter Page',"b'In March, in a bold Oh yeah? moment during an interview with the Washington Posts editorial board, Donald Trump took the papers dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, I have quite a few more. The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, Carter Page, PhD.\n\nWho?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nReporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trumps big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.\n\nThis piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.\n\nWhats this guys name? says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.\n\nI had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media, says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, Have you heard of this guy?\n\nStrangely, I\'ve never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection, Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. It\'s odd, because I\'ve heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.\n\nSomeone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character whod all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.\n\nThis has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. Im going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals. As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldnt tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldnt recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?\n\nEnter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and theyll say, Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter? says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trumps own campaign.\n\nWhat I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. Hes an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia, says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russias state oil giant. People really respect him in this industry. Hes a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation. According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officialsincluding Rosneft head Igor Sechinduring a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, its hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.\n\nPage has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his deep ties with executives at Gazprom, the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with extensive business interests in Russia and an office around the corner from Trump Tower.\n\nPage has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic Schools commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the hypocrisy of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change. He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a famous American economist and adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.\n\nAll of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of insiders, people who seem to be in Trumps orbit but who may not haveand may never have hadany access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.\n\nBut someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate corporate investigators digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other wont say who turned him on to Pages scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putins chief of staffboth of whom are on the sanctions listwhen Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.\n\nSo the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?\n\n***\n\nI should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldnt talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Pages father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.\n\nThis was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.\n\nOK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didnt know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive rsum.\n\nPages biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the rsum of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group, his bio reads. He was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.\n\nThose were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Pages tenure in Merrill Lynchs Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.\n\nSo I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasnt really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didnt know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynchs purported involvement in the deal. I dont think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political, says Craig . It closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.\n\nWhen I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Pages claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, I rolled my eyes at that one. (He, too, said he hadnt heard of Page until Trumps announcement.)\n\nFine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?\n\nTurns out, they did.\n\nHis nickname was stranichkin, from the Russian word stranichka, or little page, says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the companys financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynchs Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. It really irritated our team, Torchinsky told me over Skype. We worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and wed have to correct them. These guys didnt know what they were talking about. As for Page, He made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference, Torchinsky says. When youre dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.\n\nOK, harsh. But then I talked to Pages former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. He wasnt great and he wasnt terrible, Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone without any special talents or accomplishments, someone who was a gray spot. What can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional? he asked me.\n\nPage was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom, says Aleksashenko.\n\nWhen it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments. When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy. And, says Aleksashenko, judging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesnt really understand the topic.\n\nTrumps putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy, says Aleksashenko.\n\n***\n\nFor the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. In recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively, he wrote. Although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions. He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye Wests New Slaves and the artists creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (Slave; Pronunciation: /slv/), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.\n\nHis speech in Moscows New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word ironically. For the last 15 years, Ive been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it, he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldnt really speak Russianhe had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA. Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.\n\nPage also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. He had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didnt really want to engage, one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. That blog post about the slaves. Thats just  strange, says the Council member.\n\nHes a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldnt be in the last decile, but hed be in the second-to-last decile, says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. Youd have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.\n\n***\n\nI shouldve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaigns Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trumps second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Pages trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.\n\nI was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Pages connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russias most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?\n\nBut it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynchs London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. No one let him into Gazprom, Aleksashenko says. He didnt go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Millers hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London. Another of Pages colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Pages role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time, the former colleague said. He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year I used to do this; it doesnt require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesnt mean theyre close to him.\n\nBut the meetings did provide him with something else. Gazprom didnt need money at the time, says the former colleague. They were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is. Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies hes worked for to invest in them.\n\nAfter Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his fathers address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as founder and managing partner, even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue addressthats the one around the corner from Trump Tower which was actually the address of a co-working space.\n\nThats Carter Page, says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. Thats what hes been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, hes been trying to throw together these deals. Hes always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.\n\nIn the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russias Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russias invasion of Ukraine.\n\nI dont know this person, said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Pages trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. I give them money, I dont know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea, he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, Dont bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.\n\nYou are engaged in onanism, said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. Its bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. Its hard to have a meeting with him at all. Its absurd.\n\nAs for the FBI investigation, well, its unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them. He added, the story doesn\'t add up. What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Pages time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\n***\n\nI got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trumps senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?\n\nWho? says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.\n\nHe has no formal role in the campaign, Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.\n\nNow my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hickss denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?\n\nOne way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.\n\nOne source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trumps foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post, Burt told me. And I told him Id never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, Ive forgotten. Hes the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?\n\nSomeone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trumps Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldnt return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. If he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis, this person told me.\n\nIm not answering your questions, Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaigns other spokesperson, says, Carter Page isnt someone Ive interacted with. Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: Carter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. Hes never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.\n\n***\n\nWas Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump saidhes my adviserand what his associates saidWho? Maybe I wasnt doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.\n\nI dont know about his Russia fund, other than its never really materialized, says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. Every conversation Ive had with Carter has not been terribly serious. Theyve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities. He went on. I couldnt name a project that I could connect Carters name to, any project that actually happened.\n\nI dont know how hes earned a living off this, the energy player says, but I think hes been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, its sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.\n\nStrangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, I want to be part of the team, says the Trump adviser. And thats how it happened. Hes just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, Hes an adviser. And now hes milking it for all its worth.\n\nNow, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washingtonor at least could plausibly market himself as one. I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him, one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network, but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listenand be impressed. He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow, the Russia specialist recalls. He didnt say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.\n\nAccording to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Pages trip to Russia, the meetings did happen and thats been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them. But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. Its not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on? said the staffer. Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against Americas national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. Its whats hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carr novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?\n\nThis seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But hes also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really isand to try to turn a profit off of that. If Page using his status as Trump advisor for personal gain, thats another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter! Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russias energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energybut the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: Carter Page, Ph.D. Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.\n\nFor months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?\n\nThere doesnt seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putins: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia, Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American electionas we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think weve finally grasped it.\n\nJulia Ioffe is contributing writer at Politico Magazine.'",R

b'In Defense of He Said/She Said Journalism',"b'Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of He Said/She Said Journalism Why we must give the devil his due.\n\nThe he said/she said method of reportingin which journalists observe the professions convention and get at least two sides of every storyhas been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.\n\nBut the ""he said/she said"" debate didnt move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest birther declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled The Death of He Said, She Said Journalism, Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaros work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what theyre actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with astonishing bluntness, Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trumps birther nonsense a lie. Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and dont mind saying so, Im not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isnt that what the fact-checker columns are for?\n\nIn his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the other side of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the he said voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the she said dissent. Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out whos faking it more? Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence, he would later remark.\n\nDonald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something hes said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, hes expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that hes used terms like fat pig to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trumps she said lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the he said side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.\n\nBut has journalists\' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trumps post-truth style of politics and dont need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many dont care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the tricksters campaign hes waging for the presidency: Hes serving baloney and his supporters cant get enough of it.\n\nAs bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesnt embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical show me readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makersboth ""he said and she said""and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.\n\nOne reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling Im being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?\n\nI dont believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any fieldruling paradigms, if you dont mind the languagehave a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority reporthowever seemingly misguidedmust be heard.\n\nThe history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.\n\nOr consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geologys crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. You think, Its science; its got to be accepted, Marshall told Discover magazine. But its not an absolute given. By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.\n\nObviously, the critiques of every she-saider dont automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The one-size, fits all advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that homophobia is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant super-predator thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japans economy was supposed to overtake the United States? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.\n\nThe dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybodys knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. Thats how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. First, Salk writes, they say that it cant be true. Second phase: Well, if its true, its not very important. Third phase: Well, weve known it all along.\n\nBefore anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I dont subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I dobut at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.\n\nThe last and best reason for supporting he said/she said journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operationslike POLITICOthat make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: [I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.\n\nIf youre not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption, youre at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like its only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.\n\n******\n\nA sumptuous meal of news, news, news.

"b""Tampa man loses testicles after trying to 'fill scuba tank with weed smoke'""","b'A 32-year old Tampa local has suffered extensive injuries to his lower body after an unconventional attempt to fill a scuba tank with weed smoke failed spectacularly last night. According to the testimony of several witnesses, Darren Winters had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\n\nDarrens a recreational diver, commented one of the injured mans friends. For some time, hes been tinkering with an old scuba tank that hed bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\n\nMr Winters invited a number of his friends over to his residence, an apartment in Ybor, telling them hed finally perfected what he called his scuba bong. Clearly it wasnt a bong at all, pointed out one of his friends when interviewed by local journalists, but he was so enamoured with that name we thought best not to correct him.\n\nWhen his friends assembled at Mr Winters residence, they found him heavily intoxicated. Hed had a number of celebratory drinks before we arrived, as he was so delighted to finally have his scuba bong up and running. With his friends present, Mr Winters proceeded to offer a demonstration of the home-made device in action. This is the point that everything went horribly wrong.\n\nAccording to the witnesses, Mr Winters was attempting to reattach the air compressor when he stumbled, knocking the scuba tank off a workbench and onto the concrete floor. The tank basically exploded after [Winters] knocked it over, commented one of the witnesses. None of Winters friends were injured, but the blast from the ruptured tank sent shrapnel flying directly into his lower body.\n\nWinters friends quickly phoned for an ambulance and he was rushed to hospital, where surgeons spent over eight hours treating his extensive wounds. His condition has now been downgraded from critical to serious, but medical staff announced theyd been unable to save his testicles which had been cleanly severed by a shard of metal.\n\nPreliminary investigations have identified that the scuba tank used by Winters may be banned from dive use throughout the US. This tank was manufactured prior to 1992 and made of a type aluminium alloy that is known to have a high risk of fracturing, commented the lead investigator on the case. We regularly audit dive shops in Tampa to ensure these tanks are not being sold; however, the ban only extends to using the tank when diving. If [Winters] purchased the tank for the purpose of inhaling cannabis, the retailer has technically not breached the law.\n\nThis news will be little comfort to Mr Winters, who will likely be unable to file for compensation against the business that sold him the defective tank. The young man faces a long recovery, but his associates shared their optimism that he would pull through. Hes one of the toughest guys I know, commented one of Mr Winters friends. Hell take the fact he wont be able to have kids pretty hard, though.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post stated the victim was unemployed. Mr Winters is actually employed on a part-time basis at a Tampa pizza restaurant.

The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.\n\nThe development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become faithless or conscientious electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.\n\nThe electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamiltons Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nations highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.\n\nProponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.'",F

A Moveon.org petition was created by The Idaho Breastfeeding Law Coalition in effort to bring the state up to speed with the remainder of the states throughout the country that protect nursing mothers, however despite the petitions 4,821 signatures, there is no indication that Idaho is anywhere close to passing new legislation.\r\n\r\nBreastfeeding mapImage Source: The Huffington Post\r\n\r\nIn addition to serving a maximum 7-years in prison, because Watson was charged with multiple counts of indecent exposure, she will be required to register as a sex offender and will be placed on the National Sex Offender Registry.\r\n\r\nAccording to Heathers husband and close friends, she was an advocate for mothers rights and commonly took to social media websites such as Facebook to rant about her frequent indecent exposure citations and to complain about being harassed for breastfeeding her young daughter in a myriad of public locations. The below message was posted to Facebook a few weeks ago by Heather after she received her 4th citation for indecent exposure  Im so frickin pissed off by the barbaric, stone-age, laws we have in Idaho.

b'New York Man Wanted For Infecting 240 Men And Women With HIV!!!',"b'New York Man Wanted For Infecting 240 Men And Women With HIV!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will blow your mindRead how a New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women.\n\nI met Stephawn when I was 19 years old, explains Joshua Johnson on his blog.\n\nHe continues:\n\nAt 19, I was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation. I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.\n\nJohnson goes on to explain in great detail how he fell victim to a sexually promiscuous fugitive who is wanted for allegedly infecting at least 240 people with the HIV virus that causes AIDS.\n\nLadies, as you read Joshuas story below, keep in mind that black women are the fastest growing HIV demographic in the U.S. due to bisexual men who in relationships with women because they are confused about their sexuality.\n\nGay and bisexual men, regardless of race, are more sexually promiscuous than their heterosexual counterparts, according to Seekingarrangement.com and other reports.\n\nAuthorities in New York City are offering up to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of 31-year-old Isaac Don Burks, aka Stephawn Burks, Stefan Levine, Isaac Levine, Stefan Burks, and Walter Brooks.\n\nBurks is described as an African-American male, medium brown skin, six feet two inches tall, weighing 185 pounds. The NYPD is looking for a fugitive they say has embarked on a terrifying campaign to infect as many people as possible with the HIV virus, and they caution that his victims could run into the hundreds.\n\nIsaac Don Burks, 31, has been indicted on eight counts of criminal transmission of HIV, prosecutors announced Friday, and warned that Burks targets people via popular gay websites and networking apps, such as Adam4Adam, Grindr, Jackd, and BGCLive.\n\nBurks, a black gay man from West New York, NJ, just outside Manhattan, who police say may have started his mission to infect as many people as possible with HIV as far back as ten years ago, was described as sick in the head by one alleged victim, who notes that Burks alluded to having possibly infected as many as 300 victims. The victrim, who did not wish to be publicly identified, recalls that Burks has been on a downward spiral since the death of his mother, and plies his prey with drugs and alcolhol, to bring their guard down.\n\nAccording to New York City Health Department spokesperson Kate Caraway, this is the first time a HIV infected individual has spread HIV to so many victims.\n\nWe want to make sure that anyone who may have injected drugs with, who may have had sex with him, does come forward and get tested, she Caraway. We want to make sure that theyre not spreading the virus to anyone else.\n\nAnyone with information regarding Burks whereabouts is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 888-CRIMESC (888-274-6372). Your call will remain anonymous.\n\nThis makes the report we did on Craig Lamar Davis passing HIV around the Full Gospel Baptist Church seem like nothing.\n\nNow read Joshua Johnson story in his own words below:\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Burks aka Isaac Don Burks Pictured Above\n\nI met Stephawn, (Real Name: Isaac Burks  Isaac Don Burks), when I was 19 years old. I had just moved to Atlanta from North Carolina to attend Clark Atlanta University. At 19, I was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation. I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.\n\nYou see, my father was a pastor and my mother was a physician. I came from a very stable background, and my parents were heavily into the church. They controlled everything in my life. They financed my education, sent me money every month, and paid virtually every bill that I had. They wanted to see me succeed in life, and I didnt want to disappoint them.\n\nWhen I moved to Atlanta I met other gay men who were more comfortable with their sexual orientation. I pulled strength from these men, and bonded with them immediately. They taught me that it was ok to be gay, and that life was too short to live my life for others. Over the next few months my circle started to consist of nothing but gay men. I felt comfortable. I felt that I could express myself without judgement, and. for the first time ever I felt accepted. As time passed by, I started coming out of the closet a little more each day. At first, I would never attend a gay club because of fear of being outed. My friends eventually talked me into attending a gay club for the first time. I was nervous! You see, I had a sister who attended Spelman College and four other male cousins who attended Clark. The last thing I needed was my family to find out my sexual orientation. That would mean the possibility of my parents cutting me completely off, and they were the ones paying for my tuition, books, and college expenses.\n\nI eventually put my fears aside after a night of drinking with my friends. We loaded up into my friends Ford Explorer and headed over to a club called Traxx. Apparently, this was the gay club that everyone in Atlanta attended on Saturday. I remember walking into a place that resembled a poorly decorated high school gym. It was huge! There had to be over 1,000 people in the place, and they were dancing the night away. Because we were underage, we couldnt drink. Apparently everyone over 21 received a special wrist band to indicate their age, and no one in my party had one. After awhile of standing around we were starting to become over it. Clubs arent as fun when you are sober, and the liquor we had drank earlier was starting to wear off. While standing on the side I noticed a guy staring at me and smiling. He was very attractive, and every time I would catch him looking in my direction I would look the other way. This entire gay lifestyle was still new to me, so I didnt know what to take his stares for. Eventually he worked up the nerve to come over to me and strike up a conversation. He told me that I looked familiar, and asked me where I was from. I told him that I was from Charlotte North Carolina, and I couldnt possibly look familiar. I had never been to a gay club, and every one of my gay friends were college freshmen from different cities around the country. He asked me why I wasnt drinking, and I told him we couldnt buy drinks because we were all under 21. He offered to buy us a round of drinks at his expense. I jumped at the offer, because we wanted to enjoy ourselves that night. After all, no one comes to a club to have a bad time.\n\nHe returned minutes later with three drinks. The drinks he ordered for us were Long Island Iced Teas. I remember taking a sip and almost spitting the drink out. It was very strong. Rather than be rude and waste his money, I drank it slowly. Stephawn then asked why I was babysitting my drink. I asked what did he mean by that, because I had never heard the phrase used before. He told me to hurry up and finish my drink, he was going to order us another round. By the time the second round came, I was feeling nice. We continued to talk, and he kept buying me drinks.\n\nAfter the third round I was borderline drunk, and so were my friends. Every time he ordered me a drink, he also ordered my friends a drink too. After awhile my friends wanted to leave, and I told him that I would catch up with him later. He asked me to stay a little longer, and promised to take me home. I ditched my friends, and for the rest of the night it was just me and him.\n\nWe ended up leaving the club an hour later. While taking me home he told me that he wanted to stop by his house real quick to grab some gas money since his car was on E. We pulled into an apartment complex in the Lindbergh area of buckhead. He told me to come up with him so I did. As soon as the door to his apartment closed he started passionately kissing me. We eventually ended up in his bedroom where we kissed for hours it seemed. He started unbuckling my my pants, and I stopped him. I confessed that I was a virgin and didnt have a clue what I was doing.\n\nHe told me to relax, and that everything was cool. He said everyone started off as a virgin at some point in there life, and that he could teach me how to have sex. He made me turn over on my stomach and took my shoes off. Then he took my pants off. I was tense and nervous. I didnt know what to expect, but he was so attractive I wanted every ounce of this man. The first thing he did was start eating my ass and I moaned passionately as he gently ate my ass for hours it seemed. Next he started sucking my d***k from the back while I was laying on my stomach. It felt amazing. I wanted to please him too, but he told me to chill and go with the flow. Then he started grinding on my ass and rubbing his d***k on my ass crack. He grabbed some lotion that was strategically placed on his nightstand. He rubbed the lotion in my ass crack, and then put some on his index finger. He slowly put his finger inside of my ass. I moaned in extacy, because he was stroking my d***k while he was massaging my prostate with his finger. After awhile of fingering me, he tried to put his d***k in my ass raw. I immediately stopped him! I asked if he had a condom, and he said yea why? I said because I didnt come to Atlanta to catch anything and safe sex was mandatory with me. He ran some line about being recently tested the week before, and I said thats cool but we just met. If we were going to have a casual encounter it needed to be a safe casual encounter. He jumped up and grabbed a magnum out of his dresser. I watched him put the condom on, and then I buried my face into the pillow. It was painful at first. I didnt understand how men could possibly enjoy what felt like having your insides ripped out. I had to stop him several times, because I could not take the pain. After about 20 minutes he was starting to get impatient. I couldnt take the d***k, and he seemed to be over waiting for me to get used to the pain. I didnt want to disappoint him, and I didnt want my first sexual experience to be horrible with my partner not being satisfied. I decided to man up and squirted some more lube on my ass. I laid on my stomach, and put my face back into the pillow. He inserted his d***k inside of my ass, and this time it didnt hurt as much. He started to increase his stroke, and I had no problem taking it. He was grabbing my waist, and I attempted to throw my ass back like I had seen in the porno movies. Whatever I was doing, he was enjoing it because he was moaning in extacy. After 10 minutes of f***king me doggy style he screamed he was going to cum. As he came I felt a warm liquid inside of my ass. I jumped up and looked back and saw his d***k without a condom on it! I screamed what happened to the condom? He grabbed around the bed and showed me the condom. There was no cum in it, and it was by the foot of the bed. I ran to the bathroom, because it felt like I had to s***t. When I used the bathroom, his cum rushed out of my ass. It was allot. I kept thinking to myself that this motherf***ker took the condom off while f***king me. That was the only explanation for cum being in my ass, because I watched him put the condom on.\n\nI came out of the bathroom with an angry look on my face. I said nigga I just used the bathroom and your cum came out of my ass. I asked him if he took the f***king condom off. He said no. He said that it must have broke. I wasnt buying it, and I searched around for the condom. I found the used condom on the bed, and started examining it. The condom wasnt broke at all! I rolled it out, and there was nothing wrong with it. I screamed what the f***k did you do, because this condom isnt broken. He told me that I was tripping, and I ran to the bathroom with the condom and put it up to the faucet. I filled the condom with water and it didnt leak at all! When I did that, he told me to get the f***k out of his house. I felt betrayed, I was scared for my life, and I was hurt. I had heard about Atlanta being one of the cities with the highest AIDS rates in the country, and I was determined not to be a statistic.\n\nI got my things, and got out of his house. This asshole didnt even take me home, and it was 6am in the morning. As I waited outside of his apartments in the cold, I called a cab service. They arrived about 20 minutes later and took me home. The entire time he was texting my phone and calling me non stop. I didnt answer his calls, because I didnt want to talk to him. I was convinced that he had purposely took the condom off while f***king me. There was no other explanation for his cum being inside of me. I know some guys get off by that, but I was disgusted by it.\n\nThe thought of his cum inside me made my stomach turn. As the liquor wore off, I went into a deep depression. When I got to my dorm, I popped two tylenol pms and fell alseep.\n\nI didnt tell anyone about my experience. How could I explain that I had sex and my partner purposely took the condom off and came inside my ass unprotected. I had just met this man. I didnt even know his real name. When my friends asked me what happened, I said nothing and gave them a look that said dont ask me anymore questions!. They didnt ask, and I didnt tell. That experience frightened me so bad that I decided to put my sexual desires on hold and focused on my education. That meant pulling back from my gay friends too, because I was starting to get a little too reckless and free with my sexuality. I started hanging more with my straight friends. After all, I had to keep my charade up. I had family that attended my school, so I couldnt be seen with a bunch of gay men 24/7.\n\n8 months later while home for Christmas break I had to see my doctor for my yearly checkup. This was something my mother made me do ever year since I can remember. My doctor asked me was I sexually active, and I said no. I told him that I had sex once, but that was it. I wasnt sexually active, because I wasnt actively having sex. He told me that he was going to include an HIV test in my regular blood work anyway. A few days later I received a call from his office. It wasnt the doctor, it was one of the office workers. She was obviously new, because I didnt recognize her voice. She told me that I needed to come in, because there was something that the doctor needed to discuss with me. I was confused. I asked her what something was, and she said that she couldnt release this information over the phone and that I should come in Today. This was very unusual, because I had never had this happen before and I had been getting a yearly checkup from the same doctor for over 15 years. At first I thought it could be high blood pressure, because that ran in my family. There was also a chance of cancer, because the women in my family had breast cancer and my grandfather passed away from prostate cancer. I borrowed my mothers car, and headed over to the doctors office. I didnt want to scare her, so I didnt mention what I was borrowing the car for.\n\nI will never forget what happened next. As I arrived to my doctors office, I was told to have a seat in the waiting room. There was soft music playing that turned out to be Barry Manilows Daybreak, and it made my stomach turn! I hated that f***king song. I was in no mood to hear a happy go lucky song when I was being called into my doctors office to discuss my lab results. Before the song could end, the doctor opened the door and escorted me to an exam room. It was cold, there was no window, and the light was very bright. Brighter than usual. He began to look over my charts and lab results. He grabbed my hand, which caught me off guard, and then said Im sorry to have to tell you this, but your HIV results\n\ncame back positive. I swear I didnt even hear the word positive, I just read his lips that seem to go in slow motion. I said, Im sorry but there must be some mistake. I am not sexually active. Ive only had sex once! I havent had oral sex, or any sexual activity with anyone but one person. He said that he would order additional tests, and they all came back positive.\n\nI thought about committing suicide. I could not eat. I could not sleep. I could not focus on school. I couldnt do anything but cry. My doctor couldnt legally tell my mother I was HIV positive, but I was on her insurance so she would find out sooner or later when she saw the co-pays for the HIV meds he prescribed and the increased doctor visits. I tried to get in contact with Stephawn but his number was disconnected.\n\nWhen I got back to school, I went over to the apartment complex where he lived but I couldnt remember the apartment number. I had no way of reaching this guy. I wanted to kill him, and i was going to. I had a butcher knife and I was going to stab him thru the heart, because I knew this guy had given me HIV, because I didnt have sex with anyone else. As time passed, I became so depressed that I eventually dropped out of school. I kept thinking what is the purpose of getting a degree when Im going to die soon. I lost 15 pounds from not eating and started to look very frail. I decided to drop out of school, because I didnt know how to deal with it all. I had no one to turn to. I couldnt tell my friends, and I couldnt tell my parents. Can you imagine telling your mother that you are HIV positive after a one night stand. I couldnt dare to see the pain in her eyes of knowing her son is going to die before her.\n\nToday I read the article about Isaac Burks and saw his picture. This is the same guy who told me his name was Stephawn. This is the guy that gave me HIV! He ruined my life. I finally ended up telling my parents because I could not afford to pay the co-pays for the medication and doctor visits. My mother didnt cry, and told me that she loved me and would be there for me every step of the way. Later on that night as I got up to use the bathroom I heard her crying in her room. Tears immediately started pouring down my face and I ran to the kitchen. I slit my wrist. I wanted to die. I fell out and woke up in the hospital surrounded by my family. I have been in counseling, hiv support groups, and seeing a psychiatrist every since. Accepting the fact that I am HIV positive has been very hard. I still have not been able to return to school, and I have tried to kill myself 3 times since then.\n\nTo the sick f***k Isaac Burks, also known as Stephawn who gave me HIV, I hope you rott in hell. Now that I know his real name I will contact the authorities and tell my story. Every day I hope that things will get better, and it doesnt. I ask Why me? every day. What did I do to deserve this? I have not been able to date or have any sexual relations with anyone. I just know the minute I tell them my HIV status they will be out of the door. I am going to die alone. The last time I tried to commit suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills I woke up to my mother crying and begging me to stop. But I cant. I have nothing to live for. I am alive, but I am not living.\n\nI cried as I typed this post. I relived it, but felt I had to share my story. After finally coming out to my friends with my story I later found out that there were others that this man infected with HIV.\n\n\n\nRead Isaac Don Burks Response on his Facebook Page Below:\n\nIsaac Don Burks Facebook Page\n\nI can only say i pray 4 the person or persons responsible for creating a false story about me spreading HIV to hundreds of people. I would love to get on here and bash every lie and false story that is floating around, but i have a life to live. I have friends and family who know and love me dearly and are in my corner. I am not a person who would intentionally bring pain and hurt to anyones life. I have seen what this disease does to people first hand losing my best-friend to this at such a young age. It baffles me to think that someone would actually have so much hate in their heart to make a factitious news article and take my past experiences to add more significance to the story. Loosing my mother was a very hard thing to deal with but to say im on a downward spiral of destruction because of this is outrageous. Im actually doing a lot better with my mother in heaven because with her watching over me this lie CANNOT WIN. See sometimes people are hurt so bad in life that they do things to others intentionally and maybe accidentally but this article was definitely intentional to hurt and assassinate my character and mainly make me out to be a monster. I pray for you whoever you are. See my GOD doesnt allow me to hate or to dwell in this foolishness with the serpent. I can say that i was always taught that the devil comes to steal, kill, and destroy. SATAN get behind me because no weapon formed against me shall prosper!!!!! For the ones who are spreading the story via internet i ask u WWJD, what if this was you or your brother, uncle, cousin, farther. Im not madd because i know who i am and im better then this. When your life is going so good things come to make u backslide into worldly ways but i want. I dont have anyhing else really to say besides GOD BLESS you all'",F

b'NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 15 Days Of Darkness In November 2017',"b'There have been many reports about the changes our planet Earth could endure in the months and years to come but many of them didnt really pan out, making us question everything we read on the internet. But this time, NASA confirms whats been circling the web recently  our planet Earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in November 2017 starting from November 15 to November 29.\r\n\r\nNASA reports that this strange occurrence was expected to happen but they didnt know exactly when. Upon more detailed examination the astronomers from NASA confirmed that the phenomenon will start on November 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until November 30, 4:45 pm.\r\nimages (4).jpg\r\nAccording to experts this blackout will be caused by an astronomical event between Jupiter and Venus. There was even a detailed 1000 pages document written by Charles Bolden, head of NASA explaining the strange event to officials at the White House.\r\nAccording to the report, during this specific period Jupiter and Venus will come in close proximity of each other and will be separated by just 1 degree. Venus will move to the south-west of Jupiter and as a result it will shine 10 times brighter than Jupiter. Venus bright light will heat up the gases in Jupiter causing a reaction which will release a an absurdly high amount of hydrogen into the space. This reaction will come in contact with our Sun at 2:50 am on November 15th.\r\nOnce the hydrogen reaches the Sun, a massive explosion is bound to occur on the surface of the Sun, increasing the temperature to more than 9000 degrees. The whole process will generate so much heat that the Sun will change its color into a bluish shade. Once this happens, the Sun will need a minimum of 14 days to restore its normal color and temperature.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this strange phenomenon, the Suns light will be seen much dimmer from the Earth and hence the 15-day blackout NASA is talking about.\r\n\r\nWe do not expect any major effects from the Blackout event. The only effect this event will have on Earth is an increase of 6  8 degrees in temperature. the polar cap will be mostly affected by this. No one should worry much. This event would be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter, Bolden said.'",F
b'FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents!',"b'\n\nAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.\n\nThe allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds  literally.\n\nThis shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name Alexi Jonesinov) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.\n\nHowever, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.\n\nIt was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.\n\nIt may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.\n\nWe have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box, one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control peoples actions as Russian neuro-brain hacking.\n\nThis method was developed by the KGB, which became the FSB following the fall of the USSR.\n\nWhat we know for a fact is that the only reason anyone would vote for Donald Trump is that they were being influenced, whether through cash payments, blackmail or space beams, by Russian agents from the FSB (formerly the KGB).\n\nIf people were not beholden to Russia, they would have voted for Hillary Clinton, a senior agent said, citing a definitive analysis by CrowdStrike, a contractor hired by the DNC to investigate Russian space-beam mind control.\n\nWhen asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were ridiculous, outrageous and goofy.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer called the response from Peskov predictable, adding, what do you expect from the criminal Putinist regime that kills journalists, oppresses gays, invaded the Ukraine, murdered innocent Syrians and hacked our elections by controlling peoples brains with a space-beam?\n\nUpon hearing of the revelation of the fact that 62 million American voters are working directly for Russia, Senator John McCain has called for mass arrests. He referred to all Trump voters as radical traitors to the core values and principles of democracy and human rights, and demanded they be imprisoned and their homes given over to Syrian refugees.\n\nTOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'",F
b'2 Liberal Democrat Congressmen Arrested For Planning Trumps Assassination',"b'Need more proof that liberalism is a disease? Two United States Representatives were just arrested for plotting to carry out the assassination of President Trump. These arent some off-the-hook left wing extremists, theyre typical men with what seem like typical lives but liberalism has turned them insane with jealousy and rage.\n\nRep. Harold Spunkmeyer (D-Illinois) and Rep. Johnathon Leominster Jr (D-Massachusetts) were taken to a military holding facility under suspicion of terrorism for plotting to murder the President. Several of their closest aides as well as their families have also been detained. As we speak, a special unit of the Secret Service is closing the net on all of their friends and anyone else who could potentially cause harm to President Trump.\n\nAccording to reports, intelligence was gathered from the mens computers that they were planning to ambush the president during one of his trips to Florida, giving them 4 to 5 possible attack attempts per month to work with. Its unclear where exactly the attacks would have taken place, but the agents in charge of the investigation say they are certain the men were serious about the plan:\n\nTheir plans were hidden from plain sight in what they said was a design for a new video game, said Special Agent George Ketterman, While they never actually used the presidents name or purchased any of the items listed in the game, like grappling hooks, stinger missiles, bulletproof jetskis or yellow cake uranium, there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects.\n\nIn unrelated news, the men were known to be strong opponents of the Trump agenda and were also organizing massive protests and marches in their districts. ABC reports that between them they had raised more signatures opposing Trumps executive orders on immigration and travel than any other lawmakers in Washington.\n\nNBC News tried to reach out to the mens lawyers to see if there would be a statement available but couldnt find one.

"b""Trump Gives Chaffetz The Thumbs Up For Investigating Hillary Clinton's Email Server""","b'President Donald Trump has finally given Congress the authorization to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton.\n\nJason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, informed the committee that he had a meeting with President Trump who gave him permission to investigate whatever he wants. Chaffetz also hinted that charges against Hillary could be happening soon.\n\nHere is what Chaffetz said:\n\nPresident Trump visited Philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session. I went backstage with the President. Heres what he said: You do a great job. Listen, I understand Im the president and you have a job. You do the oversight. Dont slow down. Go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at. If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. And for him to convey a message of dont slow down, I think was a good message.\n\nWATCH:\n\nThe news that President Trump supports the investigation comes just days after the Oversight Committee ordered James Comey, (now former) FBI Director, to release the contents of Hillary Clintons email server. This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasnt yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.\n\nWithout Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. Its about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. She has to answer for that, and now that President Trump is in control, she wont make it out of this investigation so easily.\n\nWhat do you think about this?

b'A Hollywood Star Is Moving To Canada Because Of President Trump',"b'Many Hollywood celebrities announced that they will move in another country if Donald Trump won the elections. Well, the elections were held 7 months ago and he won, but no celebrity kept the promise. However, singer Cher may be the first to move to Canada because of the President. As Trump announced he wants to change the Obamacare, she took it to Twitter to express her anger.\n\nVia Clear Politics\n\n.@cher took to Twitter to blast AHCA saying its passage threatens to cut funding to treat her asthma. https://t.co/GOZhh1Ss87pic.twitter.com/0fUQSSRI4v\n\n Fox News (@FoxNews) May 5, 2017\n\n#TRUMPCARE IS SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST HEALTHCAREHUGEGIVE AWAY 4 THE RICHEST 2% OF AMERICANSDONT BELIEVE REPUBLICANS,THEY DIDNT READ BILL\n\n Cher (@cher) May 5, 2017\n\nTRUMP HAD TO DO HEALTHCARE FIRST,BECAUSE HE NEEDED 1 TRILLION HE STOLE FROM POOR, SICK,& DYING,2 GIVE TAX CUTS TO TOP 2%\n\n Cher (@cher) May 5, 2017\n\nCher is one of the many leftist famous people who constantly attack President Donald Trump. A lot of those stars have attempted to fit in the world of politics in order to defend themselves , but in most of the cases, they had no significant success, but rather ended up making a fool out of themselves.\n\nDuring the presidential race, a lot of them promised to leave the country if Trump was elected, but not a single one of them stuck to the promised.\n\nAll they want to achieve is make everyone share the same opinions they do, which is pretty contradictory to their liberal beliefs that everyone has the right of personal opinion, different than the others. On the other hand, the conservative ideology is still widely present across the USA, which makes things even more difficult for them.\n\nApparently, it would have been way better if they all simply moved to Canada. Now, they forgot what their real job is, and they take every chance to bash our President. Americans are beginning to feel nervous about and dislike it.'",F
"b'COMEY KNEW MURDERED DNC STAFFER, SETH RICH, WAS WIKILEAKS SOURCE & COVERED IT UP FOR HILLARY'","b'HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & Its NOT PRETTY  FOR THEM\n\nThe tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.  Thomas Jefferson\n\nELDER PATRIOT  Corrupt politicians ignore Jeffersons directive to their own detriment. Its no longer political, its personal.\n\nAmericans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.\n\nConservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.\n\nCruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trumps America First agenda and said, If were given the White House and both houses of Congress and we dont deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.\n\nCandidate Trump promised many things  border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and  to the extent possible  an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?\n\nAfter four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans  notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham  have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.\n\nSo, what gives?\n\nWell, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trumps promise to Drain the Swamp.\n\nAs we reported yesterday, An F.B.I. agent with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.\n\nThe criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasnt interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.\n\nDemocrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.\n\nOne Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nations loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.\n\nToday, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their childrens God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they arent the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.\n\nDonald Trumps presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.\n\nThese patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trumps Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.\n\nNo amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.\n\nSo why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? Its because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.\n\nAnd, now that theyve been caught robbing the worlds largest bank  the U.S. treasury  they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.\n\nWashingtons criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. Its time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n\nHERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP\n\nImpeach! Its been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word  long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obamas administration  but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, its back with a vengeance.\n\nDemocrats everywhere are wildly slinging the I word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nSome members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked Watergate.\n\nNow the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.\n\nWasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the lefts impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is Americas new Richard Nixon.\n\nWatergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions, says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. Now, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: Im not going to stop asking them.\n\nMeanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.\n\nThe posters read: If you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul.  Resign now.\n\nBut constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned impeachment enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?\n\nAt this time, theres no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.\n\nThe criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo, Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:\n\nFor the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.\n\nHowever, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless gotcha announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.\n\nA good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the due administration of justice.\n\nHowever, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence corruptly when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term corruptly is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another. Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.\n\n.

b'Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales 16 dead',"b'A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.\r\nThe crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (), Japans primary whaling vessel and the worlds only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ships processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.\r\n\r\nThe resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea.  The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. It was horrific claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome  scene. The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere he recalls in tears.\r\n\r\nWithin 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.\r\nThe incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.\r\n\r\nIt seems Japan just doesnt give a damn about international law explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver.

b'Its Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again says NRA President Jim Porter',"b'By Free Wood Post\n\nHOUSTON  It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water.\n\nNot long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the War of Northern Aggression. In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a fake president and Attorney General Eric Holder as rabidly un-American. However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.\n\nIm very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.\n\nWhen asked to clarify Porter said,\n\nI dont have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, its only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell wont be our leaders. Its out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know its all gonna change back. Ill be on the front lines making sure it happens. I dont want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. Its our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.\n\nSeveral at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porters remarks.

b'BREAKING Autopsy Results From Vince Fosters Exhumed BodyCause Of Death To Be Changed',"b'A string of events this week has led to incredible results in a 23-year-old case that had gone completely cold. After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Fosters death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide.\r\n.\r\nWith new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasnt autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide.\r\n.\r\nLT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospitals forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible.\r\n.\r\nThe doctor who signed Fosters death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice.\r\n.\r\nThe case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Fosters death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Director Comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureaus resources are made available.\r\n.\r\nIn other words, Clinton will be getting away with murderagain.'",F
b'The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads',"b'Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdains scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.\n\nIt looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this persons tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didnt include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.\n\nFact-checking largely didnt begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there dont seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. ""We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,"" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.\n\nCNN has also released a statement: The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation. But that still doesnt really verify that anything occurred.\n\n@solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you\'re still having an  RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016\n\n@solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you\'re home. Thanks, Melissa  RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016\n\nThe appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. Its a layup for body-part puns.\n\nThis is exactly how fake news spreads\n\nBut this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, its clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.\n\nThe stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this wont be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.'",F
b'Wasserman Schultz Going To Mental Hospital After What She Did Overnight Desperate To Escape Arrest',"b""The biggest story this week was the arrest of Pakistani Muslim and longtime aide of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Imran Awan. Earlier this year, Awan and his two other brothers were caught trying to leave the country with stolen laptops that contained top secret information from various congressmen. Shortly, after the brothers were arrested a criminal investigation commenced and Imran realized that he was going to go to jail for a very long time. In his attempt to avoid facing justice, Awan tried to flee the country but was picked up by police at the Dulles International Airport. This, of course, is scandalous, to say the least, and it was turned up another few notches after Imran hired his lawyer. The lawyer that was hired to defend Imran was no other but a close Clinton family associate and lawyer Chris Gowen.\n\nHere is more from Conservative Review:\n\nIn 2012, Gowen went to bat for Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, whose family is deeply connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. After GOP reps explored Abedins nefarious ties, Gowen pledged to stand with Huma.\n\nAlong with his private practice, the longtime Clinton aide is also an adjunct professor at American University Washington College of Law, where he teaches courses on legal ethics and law practice management.\n\nGowens Clinton connections are intriguing on another level, given that Awans employer in the House, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, remains a close Clinton confidant. The former Democratic National Committee chair resigned from her position after emails surfaced alleging she attempted to tip the scales of the Democratic primary in Clintons favor. Wasserman Schultz was also the 2008 campaign co-chair of Hillary Clintons first failed run for president.\n\nReading this you would think that the mainstream media would be reporting this story non-stop, but that has not occurred at all. In fact, ABC, NBC, and CBS have dedicated a whopping 37 seconds to this political scandal. Of course, that seems ludicrous, but it is obvious that the mainstream media does not want to get to the bottom of this at all. However, that has not stopped Americans from pressing for more information, and the heat is getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nNow, they are reports that Debbie is not fairing well, and has been an absolute wreck since Imrans arrest. Also, there are calls for Debbie to testify before Congress growing louder, and it seems that she is about to cave.\n\nHere is more from Conservative Fighters:\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz employed Pakistani IT staffers and brothers who were paid over $4 million dollars over the course of their employment even though they were accused of a cyber-security breach.\n\nImran Awan was arrested as he attempted to flee the U.S. after wiring approximately $300,000 to Pakistan. Fox News is the only cable network covering this huge scandal. When Imran Awan was arrested he was carrying $12,000 in cash on him. His wife was carrying $12,000 of cash when she fled the country too.\n\nImran and his Muslim brothers, Abid and Jamal accessed unauthorized computers while acting as IT specialists. The three brothers were making $161,000, $165,000, and $160,000 and one of the brothers has a criminal background.\n\nWord has it that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is an absolute wreck since Imran Awan was arrested. Calls for her to testify to Congress are increasingly growing as well.\n\nWasserman Schultz knows shes in hot water over this IT scandal. The Gateway Pundit previously reported the FBI seized smashed hard drives belonging to Imran Awan. We also reported that Debbie Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police with consequences for holding equipment that she says belonged to her in order to build a criminal case against a Pakistani IT staffer suspected of massive cyber security breaches.\n\nIt is rather clear in watching the video that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has something to hide. Since, why would she threaten the police if there was nothing in the equipment that could point back to her or the Clintons?\n\nJohn Cardillo reports, Florida politicos who have known Wasserman Schultz for years are telling me shes a nervous wreck, barely able to function since Imran Awans arrest.\n\nFL politicos who have known @DWStweets for years are telling me she's a nervous wreck, barely able to function, since #ImranAwan's arrest.  John Cardillo (@johncardillo) July 27, 2017\n\nThen someone witnessed Wasserman Schultz in the midst of an epic meltdown in public.

b'CNN Host Fareed Zakaria Calls For Jihad Rape Of White Women  TEO info',"b'Fareed Zakaria, CNN host of Foreign Affairs, a program focusing on international events, has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.\n\nZakarias blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.\n\nThe white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the white question will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.\n\nThankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.\n\nThe blog post was removed from Zakarias blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.\n\nCNN officials have refused to take action against their employee, stating that there was no evidence of hate speech or racism in Zakarias writings because he only targeted whites and not minorities.

b'State Of Minnesota Has Just Handed Over FULL CONTROL To Muslims So They Can Take Down Infidels',"b'There is not a day that goes by that we dont hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasnt stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called religion of peace are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for Islam anti-blasphemy laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.\n\nAnti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.\n\nAccording to Minneapolis local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to harass them. The Star Tribune reported:\n\nThe city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.\n\nThe service, operated through the citys 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice, according to a city news release issued on Monday.\n\nThe announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.\n\nSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States, Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the citys website. In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.\n\nThe citys Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated, Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the citys website.\n\nThe Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: I will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trumps desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office. The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberals alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, dont they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they dont realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslims demands. This anti-blasphemy hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germanys approach in the 1930s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think? Share this with your friends and family.\n\nH/T Freedom Daily'",F
b'Barrels Removed From Clinton Property Contained Parts From 3 Missing Women  Freedum Junkshun',"b'Three women who all went missing in the mid-1970s have turned up, at least parts of them, in a steel industrial 55-gallon drum buried on the Clinton estate in Chappaqua, New York. The barrel, which contained the arms, legs and heads of the three women, was filled with what the medical examiner calls a crude preservative.\n\nThat means that whoever put them in there wanted to be able to visit them later. Investigators were hoping to find the torsos in the second barrel recovered but found nothing but womens shoes inside, all brand new in boxes withy the tags still on them. One investigator called it the weirdest thing hes ever seen.\n\nThe three women, all of whom were in their late teens or early 20s, were hitchhiking their way from California to New York in 1974 when they disappeared. Their last known location before heading back onto the road was a motel just outside of Little Rock.\n\nIs it a coincidence that three pretty young girls who disappeared so long ago from Arkansas ended up dead and buried on a property in upstate New York? It does if you talk to the Clintons PR people:\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton have nothing to do with this and welcome any investigation with open arms. They have offered the DOJ their full cooperation. You people and your conspiracy theories that everyone who dies in America must have had a run-in with Hillary or Bill Clinton need to sit down.\n\nInvestigators say while they dont yet have enough to charge Bill Clinton, they certainly have enough evidence to question him. When they approached the house to do their jobs, they were met by a team of lawyers and Secret Service personnel and told that unless they have some real evidence, Mr. Clinton was unavailable.\n\nThey added that he felt really bad for those girls but hoped at least now their families have closure. Clinton will use ignorance and the 5th amendment to once again try to get away with murder.'",F
"b'Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies. Be careful with this, moms!'","b'It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.\n\nBut this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.\n\nA Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what shes living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.\n\nWhen she came back from work, she came into her babys room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.\n\nShe rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.\n\nShe was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasnt breathing.\n\nShe carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.\n\nThe medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.\n\nShe never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.\n\nThe thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.\n\nThe label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.\n\nSadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.\n\nWe must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.'",F
b'JUST IN TODAY Trey Gowdy Is The NEW DIRECTOR Of The FBI',"b'Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, suggested in a Friday interview that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe will be forced out at the top law enforcement agency as soon as next week.\r\n\r\nGowdy argued that newly released FBI records reveal political bias against President Donald Trump  and in favor of Hillary Clinton  at the highest levels of the FBI. Gowdy said that McCabe will likely be pushed out of the agency as a result of the perceived bias.\r\n\r\n""I\'ll be a little bit surprised if he\'s still an employee of the FBI this time next week,"" Gowdy told Fox News of McCabe, adding that he would be ""shocked"" if McCabe testifies before the House next week.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Gowdy settled a $150,000 veteran discrimination and retaliation claim from a former aide, who was fired in 2015 from the House Benghazi committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. The aide alleged that he was wrongfully terminated in part for his unwillingness to engage in what he believed was a partisan investigation into Hillary Clinton\'s time as US secretary of state.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttacks on special counsel Robert Mueller\'s team of investigators have escalated sharply in recent weeks, culminating in a partisan haranguing of the FBI director last week over the perceived missteps of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nConservative and far-right media outlets, already skeptical of Mueller\'s probe into President Donald Trump\'s ties to Russia, grew louder in their calls for FBI Director Chris Wray to either clean house or for Mueller to resign. It came after news that two special counsel investigators at one point exhibited perceived political bias.\r\n\r\nTrump again characterized the criminal justice system as ""rigged"" during a rally in Florida on Friday, echoing comments he made last weekend following former national security Michael Flynn\'s guilty plea as part of Mueller\'s probe.\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump lamented the state of the FBI, the nation\'s top law-enforcement agency, shortly before delivering a speech at an FBI graduation ceremony on Friday in Quantico, Virginia.\r\n\r\n""It\'s a shame what\'s happened with the FBI, but we\'re going to rebuild the FBI. It\'ll be bigger and better than ever,"" Trump told reporters before boarding Virginia-bound Marine One on Friday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe president also recently described the country\'s top law-enforcement agency as ""in tatters,"" but a White House spokesman said on Friday that Trump had ""full faith and confidence"" in the rank-and-file members of the Department of Justice and the FBI.\r\n\r\nAlso on Friday morning, Hogan Gidley, the White House\'s deputy press secretary, said that recently released FBI records showed ""extreme bias"" against Trump among leadership at the FBI.\r\n\r\nRecently disclosed text messages between two FBI agents assigned to the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trump\'s campaign included a reference to Trump as an ""idiot."" Both agents are no longer involved in the Russia investigation. Other records revealed edits made to soften the statement of James Comey, then the FBI director, concerning the agency\'s investigation into Hillary Clinton\'s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\r\n\r\nGidley called the records ""eye-opening"" and ""deeply troubling.""\r\n\r\n""There is extreme bias against this president with high-up members of the team there at the FBI who were investigating Hillary Clinton at the time,"" Gidley told ""Fox & Friends"" on Friday morning.'",F
b'Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas',"b'Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas:\n\nEdward Snowden (the NSA whistleblower) has made another astonishing revelation. He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIAs payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas.\n\nIn 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes.\n\nAll of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee.\n\nHe currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nI have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIAs payroll, Snowden claims. He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.\n\nSnowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas.\n\nOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIAs most efficient operatives for a long time, Snowden claims. What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobodys looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.\n\nNaijaPicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book.\n\nDespite the fact Snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of America by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the USA. This is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for Snowden to be pardoned. This was rejected by the White House rejected on July 28, 2015.\n\nWhilst resident in Hong Kong, Snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. He was asked why he left his own country, his reply to The Guardian was:\n\nI dont want to live in a society that does these sort of things I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.\n\nSource : Unknown But Not Hidden; Image Source: Awareness Act'",F

Just moments ago, Freedom Crossroads Correspondent Louis Leweigh confirmed that The coroner just left the scene where Monica Lewinsky, who we now know never ended her affair with Clinton, was found murdered in a burglary.\n\nPolice Chief Randall Getty told Leweigh:\n\nPretty cut and dry. We have a suspect we think we have on several area cameras who is a known pot addict. Hes been in and out of jail more than a dozen times for possession. Were looking at him and were also considering because of the high-profile nature of the case other suspects like the Clintons.\n\nWhen Louis asked him if the feds would take over he said that every protocol has changed for the past few months but hes fairly certain anything that has to do with anyone named Clinton will be on the Justice Departments radar. In this case, to not investigate would be silly.\n\nChief Getty felt pretty strongly that his pothead was the culprit. He may have seen or heard something that cant be released yet. If that turns out to be true, the feds need to investigate this pot addict and find out just how much he was paid to be a patsy.\n\nThe cause of death is still unknown.

Skip Tetheluda, whose jerky has landed more than a few exclusive interviews, says Argueta was told to take Depp deep and dark into the night, make sure they werent followed and bring him for advanced interrogation. He responded to allegations that this takes a joke by an actor way too far:\n\nPeople just assume he was kidding. What they dont know is that Depp actually had maps and timetables and plans to assassinate President Trump if he ever visited Concord, New Hampshire again, which he certainly would during the 2020 general election season.\n\nDepp is a dangerous criminal. Some of the content on his computer indicate he may have been radicalized while he was studying in Muslim waters for his Captain Jack Sparrow role.\n\nThere you have it. If they found out Depp was a Muslim convert with plans to kill the President he may never see the light of day again.

b'Mike Pence: Allowing Rape Victims To Have Abortions Will Lead To Women Trying To Get Raped',"b'The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women cant get legally at all.\n\nAsked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented. So, lets get that straight right away  I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasnt developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if were murderers of innocent beings who cant defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other? the Indiana governor said.\n\nAnd as if that wasnt enough, Pence continued, weve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And thats bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost  we cant have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, lets be clear. And thats part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or Im going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.\n\nPence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma, he said. However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? Wed then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.\n\nDonald Trumps new running mate also said, Basically, if Id have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what theyd do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, its not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butchers knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And Im not a murderer.\n\nAnd it gets worse  when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indianas economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, Im telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run, Pence concluded.'",F
b'Pence: Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady Weve Ever Had',"b'Mike Pence said he didnt understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior  which she said had shaken (her) to the core.\n\nFirst and foremost, Pence argued, I have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. Thats the first thing I dont quite get. Secondly, if shes the First Lady, shouldnt she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? Whats she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? Thats not what she should be doing.\n\nThe governor of Indiana also said that she has no business commenting on men and their restroom talk, as well as that thats not ladylike behavior. Now, I know that the word lady is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me shes not behaving like one, at least as of late, he said. If she was a real lady, she wouldnt be commenting on mens restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.\n\nHe continued, If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadnt heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar shes not only being vocal about it, but shes also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who cant see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She cant fool me, just like she cant fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.\n\nHow many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk? Pence asked. He has apologized for it several times, and I really dont know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasnt enough, the first lady also thinks shes ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. Thats just ridiculous.\n\nThere is no way in hell Michelle Obama isnt working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And Im actually glad thats the case because when Donald wins, well offer all of them a job just for the fun of it, Pence concluded.'",F
b'Eric Trump My Fathers Tax Return Is Irrelevant Because Were Going To Cancel Taxes For WEALTHY People Anyway',"b'President Donald Trump was very active on Twitter Easter morning and lashed back at protesters wanting to see his tax returns, saying he shouldnt have to show them since he easily won the Electoral College. Moments after he defended no longer calling China a currency manipulator, now that they are giving him a helping hand with North Korea, Trump dismissed calls for his tax returns by responding on Twitter. I did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again? Trump tweeted.\r\n\r\nAs always, his son Eric was there to provide a helping hand in defending his father. During an brief phone interview with KYXL Radio based out of Orlando, Florida, President Trumps second son argued that his fathers tax return is irrelevant, largely because he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes. He said, When you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.\r\n\r\nEric continued, And while were on the subject, I kind of have to say, its funny how taxes work. They sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets. Thats kind of not fair. What he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time, rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight. The worst part is, Im not saying something thats revolutionary here; this system has been in place ever since the country was established. My father, regardless of the fact that hes president, is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system. Thats a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe self-proclaimed businessman then revealed plans to fix the broken tax system of the United States. At the end of the day, its irrelevant whether my father choses to disclose his tax return or not. It wont matter soon anyway, Eric argued. Asked to elaborate, he said that President Trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that cancels taxes for extra productive people in the U.S. economy. Its our way of saying good job to all those hard-working men and women who are single-handedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes. It is to them that this country owes its gratitude. They are the reason we are the single greatest nation in the world.\r\n\r\nAs for the fact that my father happens to be among the people who are to be freed from paying tax, I can assure you there is no conflict of interest there. This is not a move designed to make it so my father doesnt have to pay tax; like I said, its a sort of thank you from him to the entrepreneurs, businessmen and other hard-working Americans who have done their duties thus far. As for the rest, I guess theyll just have to find some other way to get free meals once the economy starts favoring those who are willing to actually get off their butts and go to work. No more freeloaders, thats where were going with this. Bottom line, if youve got two working legs and a minimally functioning brain, you can sustain yourself. And youre going to have to pretty soon, Eric concluded.'",F

In an appearance on CBSs Sunday Morning, the Million Reasons singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. Im very acutely aware that once I cross that property line Im not free anymore, Gaga said.\n\nIts like Im stepping out into this entirely different world where everybodys allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I cant even call the police to help me because theyre not doing anything wrong, the singer complained. I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me Id have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off  weve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.\n\nAsked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasnt her first choice, as well as that he couldnt have picked a worse time to become President of the United States, due to the fact that I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House. It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I havent been able to do that in a long time, she revealed.\n\nSo, Im sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but Im afraid Im going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever Im out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well, the singer revealed. At this point Im not sure whether thats going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask thatll cover my face, but what I do know is thats the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. Im too good looking to be changing my face at this age.\n\nUntil Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybodys life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where Im able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, Ill be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say  I guess Ill need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House, Gaga concluded.\n\nvia: therightists.com\n\nLady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More'",F

Obama decided your fallen didnt deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.\n\nObamas spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldnt be offended. Apparently its more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harms way to save the innocent to be honored.\n\nPresident Trump has righted that wrong once and for all.

The ranch, just a few hundred miles north of anything in Wyoming, was also seized along with a fleet of automobiles, recreational vehicles and other property now considered the spoils of the drug trade.\n\nThe bust itself yielded more than $6 million in finished drugs alone, never mind the plants and raw product waiting for packaging.

b'White House Chef Quits Because Trump Has Only Eaten Fast Food For 6 Months  The Halfway Post',"b'Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.\n\nMead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasnt utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.\n\nIts kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef, said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal hes eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trumps orders from drive-through windows and scoop the Presidents ice cream from the carton.\n\nMr. Trumps favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the Presidents eating habits to the press.\n\nIts borderline creepy, the staffer said. The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like hes dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. Its gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.\n\nMr. Trumps McDonalds habits are even weirder.\n\nHe orders the same thing every time, said the staffer. He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&Ms. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.\n\nNo wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit.

b'Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna',"b'On Monday, Bumble Bee Foods and 2 employees were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna. Jos Melena was performing maintenance in a 35 foot long oven at the companys Santa Fe Springs plant when coworkers loaded it with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and turned it on. Temperatures reached 270 during a two-hour process to cook and sterilize the tuna. The body of Melena,62, was found when the oven was opened.\r\n\r\nThe company, its plant operations director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules that caused a death. The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require: implementing a safety plan; rules for workers entering confined spaces; and a procedure in place to keep machinery or equipment turned off if somebody is working in.\r\n\r\nRodriguez, 63, of Riverside and Florez, 42, of Whittier could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges.

"b'Paul Ryan: 22 Million Americans Choose To Be Poor, So Its Their Own Problem If They Cant Afford To Be Healthy'","b'House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) this week disputed reports that 22 million people would lose insurance under the Republican health care plan. During an interview that aired on Tuesday, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade asked Ryan to respond to a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the Senates version of the health care bill is signed into law. What they are basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office, if youre not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if youre not going to force people to buy something they dont want, then they wont buy it, the Speaker opined. So, its not that people are getting pushed off a plan, its that people will choose not to buy something that they dont like or want.\n\nKilmeade then asked Ryan to comment on the fact that the Republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer Americans. Ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is a choice. This is something weve been over on more than once occasion, Ryan said. I know why youre asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? Well, Im sorry Brian, but its not working. And the reason why its not working is, youre using the wrong logic here. Youre using the wrong logic alongside millions of other Americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. Thats not right.\n\nWhy should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who dont want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance? Ryan opined. The answer is  they shouldnt. This is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. And thats the only condition, working hard. If you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. Now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if thats a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. But, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then youre doomed.\n\nBeing rich or poor is a matter of choice; thats all there is to it. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not theyre going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy. Think of the message wed be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people. Wed be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing. Just come on over and become a U.S. citizen  the government will get you free food, free shelter and free health insurance, and you dont even have to get a job. Thats preposterous, anyone who thinks thats a good thing deserves to be poor, he concluded.'",F
b'Evangelical Leader Says Those Who Oppose Trump Could Be Punished with Gay Child',"b'Donald Trump may be an adulterer, he may be crude, and he may have cheated people out of the money he owed them. If you doubt that Donald Trump is Gods chosen leader, however, you may be inviting misfortune upon yourself and succeeding generations of your family according to some Evangelical leaders. Mary Colbert for one, is certain of this:\n\nIts not that Donald Trump is all that perfect of a guy. We all know hes not. And we know that hes not necessarily perfect in every way that we would like. Thats not how God works. He works through the ones he chooses. We dont choose them.\n\nAll we have to do is recognize them and when you recognize a chosen one and you have the discernment to know that theyve been chosen and know that thats the will of God, then your life will be blessed. And if you come against the chosen one of God, you are bringing upon you and your children and your childrens children curses like you have never seen. It puts a holy fear in me.\n\nEvangelist Kenneth Copeland echoes Mary Colberts warning, and fleshes out how God will mete out punishment for not supporting President Trump, when he appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network last year:\n\nIf Christians dont support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God. Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.\n\nCopeland appeared on Colberts Pray for America call-in prayer this morning, and from the looks of what we see here, it was a meeting of like minds.\n\n\n\n'",F
b'Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because Santa Was Always White In The Bible',"b'The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Foxs Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.\n\nAmong many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the companys actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and running Mall of America into the ground, on the basis of Santa always having been white in the Bible. No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong, Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\n\nShe also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was the last straw in corporate Americas twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, because they realized they couldnt make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques theyve been using so far. She added, Thats why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they wont shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I dont understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.\n\nThats why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again, Palin added. The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we dont, if we let them get away with it, whats next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, were going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think thats happening by accident?\n\nNope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning, she concluded.'",F
b'Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If Its Out Of Love',"b'The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couples southern California home.\n\nI was wondering when this would come up, Bannon told Politico. Its been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trumps campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while were on the subject, Im actually disappointed; I honestly didnt expect them to take this long, he said laughingly.\n\nAsked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that arent targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, its just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? Its so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.\n\nBut, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, Alright, look, thats the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things youre not supposed to in a relationship, thats the whole beauty of it. And just like theres no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as youre doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, Ill have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I dont mean that in everyday life. Im talking about when theyre performing their marital duties, he argued.\n\nSo, thats why I find these charges preposterous, theyre so idiotic that Im not even sure how theyre still interesting, Bannon added. Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.\n\nAnd when youre in love, everythings allowed, I dont care what anyone says, when you say the words I do, and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it? he concluded.\n\nsource:politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments'",F
b'Trump on Revamping the Military',"b'COSTA MESA, Ca.  GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to make the military great again, saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster Americas armed forces. Were bringing back the draft, okay? Were going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties, Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.\n\nI love the Sixties, said Trump, continuing, I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do. In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. Were not going to give it to them, folks. Theyre going to have to earn their citizenship.\n\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he wont rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing man-portable tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. Were not going to have unquestionable military dominance if were seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.\n\nRather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option extremely liberally. My feeling is we have these weapons and weve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; theres absolutely no reason why we shouldnt be using them.\n\nThe former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. This guys the president of the United States and hes bowing to the Chinese. Theyre laughing in our faces, okay? Theyre laughing in our faces and if we dont do something about it, theyre going to surpass us militarily and economically and then were going to have a huge problem on our hands.\n\nDonald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address Californias Republican convention on Friday.'",F
"b""Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death - Story""","b'Seth Rich Seth Rich\n\n- EDITOR\'S NOTE (5/17/17): We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich\'s family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.\n\nWhat he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich\'s murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.\n\nIn an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:\n\nFOX 5 DC: You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...\n\nWHEELER: ""For sure...""\n\nFOX 5 DC: ...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?""\n\nWHEELER: ""Absolutely. Yeah. That\'s confirmed.""\n\nIn the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.\n\nSince Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn\'t return calls or emails.\n\nOn Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as ""miscommunication.""\n\nWhen asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich\'s family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.\n\nWe reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, ""The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler\'s conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.""\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal story:\n\nIt has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation\'s capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.\n\nRich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District\'s Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich\'s work at the DNC.\n\nJust two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich\'s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.\n\nRod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich\'s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler\'s services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""\n\nNow, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.\n\nWheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Richs murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.\n\n""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming, said Wheeler. They haven\'t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.\n\nWhen we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, Absolutely. Yeah. That\'s confirmed.""\n\nWheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I cant share any information with you. Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I dont think it comes from the chiefs office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor\'s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].\n\nWheeler told FOX 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details.\n\nFOX 5\'s Melanie Alnwick spoke with D.C. Police on Tuesday and was told that Wheelers assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the Rich case was false.\n\nThe family sent Alnwick a statement on Tuesday with the following statement:\n\n""As we\'ve seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press. Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we\'ve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth\'s murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE ON THE SETH RICH MURDER INVESTIGATION:\n\nFamily of DNC staffer Seth Rich seeking to raise money to help solve his murder\n\nRepublican lobbyist says murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich linked to Russian operatives\n\nMother of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich pleads for public\'s help\n\nRepublican lobbyist offers $100K reward in murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich\n\nWikiLeaks offers $20K reward in murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich\n\nWikiLeaks founder addresses death of DNC staffer Seth Rich in Fox News interview\n\nComments by Julian Assange fuel speculation that murdered DNC staffer may have been WikiLeaks source\n\nWhat happened during final hours slain DNC employee Seth Rich was alive?\n\nParents of slain DNC employee make emotional plea to help find son\'s killer\n\nDNC honors murdered staffer Seth Rich with memorial bike rack outside of headquarters\n\nVigil held for slain DNC staffer in Bloomingdale\n\nDNC employee fatally shot in Northwest DC'",F

""You wouldn\'t get this from any other guy,"" he added, shaking his head.\r\n\r\nIn California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.\r\n\r\nCourts in the US had earlier blocked Trump\'s travel ban executive order.\r\n\r\nKeen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.\r\n\r\nReacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.\r\n\r\nOn Trump\'s claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.\r\n\r\nLast month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over \'blasphemous content\'.\r\n\r\nLately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump\'s executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.\r\n\r\nEmployees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump\'s remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg\'s response has gone viral.'",F

NYC Police Sargeant Michael OLeary told reporters that while he couldnt confirm the identity of the driver, a well-known news anchor was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident.\n\n\n\nEMTs on the scene were heard on their radios describing the man as Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson after retrieving his wallet. He was transported to Saint Marys where he is said to be in critical condition and awaiting surgery. No other information is available from the hospital, which also refuses to release anything until they get the OK from police.\n\n\n\nThe car that crossed the median and struck Carlson had a reinforced bumper and the steering wheel was covered with foam to provide the driver extra protection from a crash. Its obvious that someone wanted to do harm to another human being on purpose. Whether or not Carlson was specifically targeted or just in the wrong place at the wrong time remains unknown. The perpetrator fled the scene. The Ford Explorer he was driving had no plates or VIN numbers. Police have impounded it as evidence.\n\n\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with Tuckers family tonight.

b'ProLifers Declare Ejaculation Is Murder Every Sperm Cell Is A Life',"b""The pro-life movement in the USA have stated that they believe that human life starts at the moment of conception and so the human fetus can be considered a human being, and hence they should have their rights to live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently, another argument broke out last month which has created a huge debate regarding abortion. Different religious groups have different views on this topic. Pro-lifers have stated that they believe that ejaculation is equivalent to murder and there should be laws to stop that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel Stratt, a pro-life activist commented that conception is the starting point of life, and that is why they don't believe in birth control. According to them, semen has been provided by the Almighty for a particular purpose to seed life and wasting it is simply showing your disrespect towards God. They believe that every sperm cell is life, and ejaculation means killing all those babies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pro-life protesters are now asking the government to make a law which would make ejaculating for own gratification illegal throughout the USA. So many lives are lost only because men ejaculate watching p0rn videos on adult sites like Pornhub just to satisfy themselves. This is murder, there is an urgent need to protect the sperms, and the babies.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a petition was submitted on Change.org stating that sperm wastage due to self-satisfaction should be made illegal, and it has already received over 85,000 signatures.

b'John Hagee Calls For Prosecuting Women Who Say Gods Name During Intercourse',"b'One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lords name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain (Exodus 20:7). The word vain means for no reason or useless.\n\nThus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written Gods name was holy and should not be used for regular words.\n\nDr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.\n\nSaying the Lords name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America, Hagee elaborated. But, thats precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I dont think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.\n\nThe pastor reprimanded: But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.\n\nAsked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: Well, wed have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If youre asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using Gods name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lords name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of Gods wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Makers good name./religionlo.com/\n\nComments\n\ncomments'",F

Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.\n\nTrump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obamas arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News:\n\nThe proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clintons aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we cant find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.\n\nThe call, between Obama and Huma Abedin, was intercepted by the FBI after President Trump ordered Obamas phones tapped to catch him in a lie over the Russia scandal. That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will be pardoning him anytime soon.""",F

Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best.\n\nNews of this comes as Russias hacking and involvement into altering the 2016 Election have become clearer. In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions.\n\nIf the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment, Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. Washington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it.\n\nWe did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know youll always remember me as the greatest President EVER!\n\nWe think this is the best thing, Ryan continued. He has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined.

I offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new President.\n\nLloyd Glacier, a spokesman for Sock It Forward, a charity started by Donald Trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with Trumps plan to resign.\n\nThis will give Trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. And just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. Socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country.\n\n38-year-old Paul Horner, a Christian mascot who goes by the name Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, said he is sad to see Trump go.\n\nWhen Im traveling around the country speaking to Elementary School children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, I see firsthand the progress that Donald Trump has made in this great Christian nation of ours, Horner said. Trump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country. He was only months away from signing legislation that would have made masturbation illegal and now its all gone. It looks like the heathenish masturbators have won and the Devil is extremely pleased.

b'Trump Caught INVESTING in Dakota Pipeline Before Signing It',"b'CNBC reported that Trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. Trumps early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.\n\nDonald Trumps business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.\n\nThe construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.\n\nThe pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.\n\nOpposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.\n\nThe opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trumps own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.\n\nVeterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.\n\nAnd now we learn that President Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.\n\nThis should come as no surprise since Trump s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.\n\nThis involvement is another example of Trumps unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.\n\nAccording to Ethics experts, Trumps decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.\n\nThe blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.\n\nThe Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trumps support of the cruel actions of the police.\n\nWe must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.\n\nPlease share this story on Facebook!'",F
b'Trump Has The Legal Right To Cancel SCOTUS Because They Serve At His Pleasure',"b'During a Monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the president was sending thoughts and prayers to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in London and to the families of seven dead U.S. sailors. Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. If you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president, he said. That is a fact.\n\nAsked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the presidents power, or in other words, its limitations  if they exist  Spicer argued that the Constitution clearly states what the President of the United States can and cannot do. However, he added, one must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isnt ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the presidents power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesnt do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.\n\nSpicer continued, As a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, theres a real need to follow the aforementioned if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.\n\nThis is something thats necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something thats exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States, Spicer concluded./politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments'",F

If you are graciously accepted into a country and you cant even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Heres the national anthem:\n\nAustralians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; Weve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in natures gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In historys page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross Well toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those whove come across the seas Weve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.\n\nSuper oppressive lyrics, right?\n\nIf a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.\n\nMoreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.\n\nIf those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enterits really that simple.\n\nWatch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.\n\nThis is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nations population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!\n\nEither assimilate, or LEAVE.\n\nThey are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. Its their faith. The west doesnt get it because most liberals are faithless.\n\nIt irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then dont want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australians convert or be beheaded!\n\nIt makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldnt pray but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they wont want to learn the country they have invaded history because its not theirs!\n\nMuslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.\n\nThis what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.\n\nDo you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?'",F

"b""Virginia Republican Wants Schools To Check Children's Genitals Before Using Bathroom""","b'335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their anatomical sex:\n\nLocal school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.\n\nHe did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but its hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the students rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.'",F
"b'If A Woman Is Not Intelligent Enough To Keep Her Legs Closed, How Can We Entrust The Abortion Decision To Her?  WalkWithHer'","b'Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called heartbeat bill, a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant womans life or preventing the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\n\nAt the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions, Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, Im sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.\n\nHe continued, Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And theres one very simple reason why I did it. Thats that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when theyre supposed to be closed, if she doesnt have the foresight to make sure she doesnt get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.\n\nA woman like that can barely take care of herself, and were supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child  a being whos done no wrong and only exists as its mothers mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter? Kasich said. I dont know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.\n\nAnd Ill tell you another thing  as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isnt married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open, the governor concluded.\n\nSource:newslo.com'",F
b'Obama Goes To G20 Summit',"b'62.1k SHARES Share\n\nObama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.\n\nObama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obamas administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.\n\nThe liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administrations problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?\n\nThe funny thing, a White House official said, is that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.\n\nBut I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel, he went on, no one in the press would say it was her staffs fault.\n\nThat is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?\n\n(h/t Young Conservatives)'",F
b'BREAKING Clinton Foundation Ordered To Cease Operations  Chelsea Charged With Fraud',"b'As we know, Clinton Foundation has been given an A+ as a charitable organization. It slightly made more reputable than the Red Cross. Now, it has been ordered to cease operations. Chelsea Clinton, the CEO, has been charged with fraud and a warrant issued for her arrest. But, following this news, Clintons were nowhere to be found for an interview.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind the shutdown is the alleged pay for play donations that saw rich and powerful terrorists gain access to Washington DC in exchange for cash. During Clintons time as Secretary of State, its been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with Obama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories. Then, the creator of ISIS, Osama Bin Laden was sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death.\r\n\r\nSo, it all comes down to how Chelsea Clinton used her family foundations cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents. Doug Band, formerly a top aide to President Bill Clinton, griped about the former first daughters spending in a Jan.4, 2012, email released by WikiLeaks.\r\n\r\nThe investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents, Band wrote to John Podesta, now Hillary Clintons campaign chairman.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will speak to her and end this.

I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.\n\nSo then the one guy finds out that Im not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and Im thinking, Sure, what the hell.

These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.\n\nIm telling you, these people in Rochester are the real deal.

b'New law now charging all violent protesters with terrorism spread the news and share this',"b'This is a disaster. In late December, State Senator Doug Ericksen proposed a new law that would give authorities the ability to charge protesters with ""economic terrorism,"" and slap them with serious felony charges that could lead to jail time, just for making their voices heard.\r\n\r\nThe outrageous bill, which has now had been formally introduced for consideration during the 2017 legislative session, would make any form of protest that causes an ""economic disruption"" a class C felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. It wouldn\'t just apply to people who engage in illegal acts or vandalism, it could be used to prosecute any person or group who organizes a protest that authorities deem as ""disruptive."" Broadly interpreted, this law could apply to time honored traditions of nonviolent dissent like boycotts and civil disobedience.\r\n\r\nWeve already hit our initial goal of 50,000 signatures on the petition. But now that the bill has been introduced, we need to get even more people speaking out. If everyone reading this shares the video, we can easily get 100,000 signatures before we deliver it to the Washington State lawmakers.\r\n\r\nCharging protesters with terrorism clearly violates the First Amendment and is an attempt to silence legitimate dissent.

b'GEORGIA BECOMES FIRST STATE TO BAN MUSLIM CULTURE IN HISTORIC MOVE TO RESTORE WESTERN VALUES!!!  News 4 Everyday',"b'When Donald Trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was at a time when Europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed.\n\nWhether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christianthey all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States.\n\nA Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils.\n\nState Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for drivers license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving.\n\nSpencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencers bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk.\n\nThis bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us, Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta.\n\nMany people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose.\n\nHere is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible?\n\nQuran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.\n\nI will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.\n\nFight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority.\n\nIs that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities?\n\nJust for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someoneso how is this any different?\n\nThere is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe.\n\nWhile Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation.\n\nThe threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans.'",F
b'White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery',"b'On Sunday, ex-Rep. Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has sanctioned violence, as long it protects the people favorable to the Obama position, politically. She insisted that the president is sending a signal to Donald Trump supporters: Dont attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted. She also linked the Obama administrations lawlessness to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving normal people helpless in the face of anarchy.\n\nAnd these days it has become so obvious that Im honestly surprised were not having riots throughout the country, she said. When did this become a nation of criminals? I didnt get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. Im not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.\n\nThe ex-Rep. then argued that not even slaves suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. Its true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, Im not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear  were supposed to be all evolved right now, were supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? Hes protecting those who want to hurt white people, as youve seen in Minneapolis.\n\nIn fact, Bachmann continued firing, I dont think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to whats been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obamas presidency. She added, Because, lets face it, during that time, weve had the Supreme Courts decision to legalize same-sex marriage, weve had countless terrorist attacks, weve had many racial killings and crimes and weve had several small-scale revolutions in some of Americas major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, Im guessing he does.\n\nAnd lets get one thing straight  Im not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, Id be saying the same thing all over again, Bachmann quipped. Thats what Im trying to point out  white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that Im seriously worried whether or not well still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate were going, all we need is another black president four years from now and well be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another  white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And thats just one step away from extinction, Bachmann concluded./politicot.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments'",F

Scot Baio had to be ejected from auditions when he found out he didnt get the part.\n\nNow the project is on hold as the other person cast perfectly for the role was Florence Henderson, who passed away recently, but producers are hoping to fill the gap with Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond.\n\nMeryl Streep, who hasnt worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes, is said to be almost broke and that the millions from this project were to basically cover her retirement. The date for that has been moved up now that shes been deemed overrated by Trump and irrelevant to most Trump supporters, which basically covers the known world and the leader of it.\n\nRELATED:\n\nDonald Trump Just Coined A New Phrase Youre Going To Love\n\nIf we learned anything from Meryl Streeps long-winded, elitist rant, its that we shouldnt try to bother understanding vocabulary thats over our heads. We sure dont want to be bothered watching a six-minute video when theres 1 and 2-minute videos of hot blondes on Fox telling us the stuff we want to hear.\n\nThats why libtards have to live their lie. Because the beautiful women of the smartest network on TV make them jealous.""",F
b'JEFFERSON DAVIS STATUE TO BE REPLACED WITH OBAMA LIKENESS',"b'Workers in New Orleans dismantled the citys Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.\n\nAs workers slung a strap around the statues waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.\n\nThis historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.\n\nThe Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.\n\nIt will be nice, Landrieu said, to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.\n\nThe Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.\n\nLike an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.\n\nBeaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.\n\nWe would have preferred it to be in the daytime, Johnson said, so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.\n\nBefore the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators  both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included Wheres Mitch? while opponents chanted, Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.\n\nAs Fox news reported earlier, the mayors plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.'",F
b'Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression',"b'Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.\n\nAccording to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.\n\nPolice arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.\n\nResponding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.\n\nWhen the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as  Enyas Who Can Say.\n\nAfter attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.\n\nThe responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the homes basement.\n\nAccording to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basements concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.\n\nWilliam Provost, who police believe to be the groups ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:\n\nI find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they dont, so I stick to what works for me.\n\nUpon searching the homes basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.\n\nPolice also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.\n\nIn addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift tool wall that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.\n\nUpon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.\n\nVernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.\n\nThough modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that Ive ever heard.\n\nProvosts accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officers that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.\n\nAll three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.'",F
"b'Barack Obama Tweets SICK Attack On John McCain, Says He Should Have Died'","b'Barack Obama is a sick human being unfit for any political office past, present, or future. Just like ultra left-wing Bernie Sanders supporter Caitlin Johnstone, Obama (Barry Soetoro as he was known in college while he was doing sexual favors for old men to get cocaine money) attacked a recovering John McCain viciously Wednesday night then deleted the tweet like a coward.\n\nJohn McCain is NOT a war hero, our Muslim former President said, adding that if there were any god in heaven the Senator would have died from his brain tumor.\n\nObama had previously tweeted out wellwishings at 8:49 p.m. and apparently accidentally sent his REAL feelings (seemingly intended for a private message) which he quickly hid from the world.\n\nThe tweet was deleted within two minutes but was already shared by more than 73,000 liberals who want nothing more than to see someone who has served our country die in agony.He even brought Gods name into it.\n\nObama has repeatedly attacked our servicemen for more than eight years, doing more damage to them than ISIS and al Qaeda combined according to a study done by the Freedom Coalition for Conservative Values\n\nYou have to realize that liberals like Obama pledged themselves to Satan long ago and are nothing but a bunch of idiot lowlifes.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump tweeted his thoughts and prayers to McCain because they are Christians who love everyone even if they have had their differences in the past:\n\nMelania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family. pic.twitter.com/SO4XYgnyug  President Trump (@POTUS) July 20, 2017\n\nIts up to us to stand with our CHRISTIAN President Trump and oppose the liberal hatred, to continue fighting to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\n\nSOURCE'",F

b'Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public',"b'Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public\n\nAustralia may become the first country in the world to microchip its public. NBC news predicted that all Americans would be microchipped by 2017, but it seems Australia may have already beaten them to it. Back in 2010, CBS news reported that the Australian government had a potential RFID microchipping plan in the works related to the health care system.\n\nNow, it seems that this plan is beginning to unfold but the push is not a result of mandated health care reforms, but rather a clever propaganda campaign that equates RFID microchipping with becoming superhuman, and people are begging for it.\n\nUnder the headline Australians embracing super-human microchip technology, Australias premier media outlet news.com.au (News Corp Australia) reports: It may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of Australians are turning themselves into super-humans who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand.\n\nShanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin. Now she can get into work and her car without carrying a card or keys, and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards.\n\nShe told news.com.au:\n\nYou could set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or PINs its the same technology as Paypass, so Im hoping youll be able to pay for things with it.\n\nWith Opal you get a unique identification number that could be programmed into the chip. Any door with a swipe card  it could open your computer, photocopier. Loyalty cards for shops are just another thing for your wallet.\n\nThe microchips, which are the size of a grain of rice, can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones, and hold complex medical data. In her interview with the Australian news outlet, Shanti claims that her friends and family are envious of her microchip lifestyle:\n\nMy nana wants one. Ive had more opposition to my tattoos than Ive ever had to the chip. My friends are jealous.\n\nIn fact, the 27-year-old has noticed a business opportunity and set up a distribution service called Chip My Life with her husband, Skeeve Stevens where for just $80 to $140, people can become so called super humans. On the same day this news story broke, Shanti appeared at Austarlias launch of the much anticipated cyborg themed video game Deus Ex Mankind Divided, alongside American implantable technology pioneer Amal Graafstra.\n\nAs you can see, the push for RFID microchipping and assimilating the human population with robots and technology, is something that will most likely be sold to the public as helping them to become super human, but clearly if you become part machine/computer, that means there will be someone who can control that technology. If you think the elites wouldnt capitalize on such an exceptional opportunity to control the population you obviously dont know history very well.\n\nAmal Graafstra, who became one of the world first RFID implantees back in 2005, just made headlines recently in the US with a prototype of the worlds first implant-activated smart gun and is a huge proponent for this new technology.\n\nHes written a book, spoken at TEDx and also appeared in a number of documentaries.\n\nIn an interview with the Australian media outlet, Amal explained that the technology he has implanted into his body has given me the ability to communicate with machines. Its literally integrated into who I am.\n\nShanti has bought into the culture that dominates society today, which is one dominated by the fantasy of super heroes that mesmerizes the population at theaters all across the globe.\n\nEver since watching movies like the Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report I wondered if we could actually live like that. I always wondered why we all werent living as super-humans.\n\nClick to WATCH: Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public'",F
b'Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His Murder Trump Video',"b'Snoop Dogg, major pothead and advocate of violence as a form of protest, has landed in hot water over his video Lavender, in which he shoots Donald Trump. In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but thats not what got him in trouble.\n\nAfter the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:\n\nNo, man. I dont like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. Thats not violenceits survival of the species.\n\nThe reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.\n\nAccording to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not hes a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trumps America if you say and do stupid crap.'",F
b'NBC Just Fired Megyn Kelly Before Her New Show Begins',"b'Share Facebook\n\nAccording to sgsnews:\n\nNBC Just Fired Megyn Kelly Before Her New Show Begins.\n\nMegyn Kelly turned down a $20 million payday to stay with the only trusted name in news for a daytime slot where she could play a white version of Oprah Winfrey on NBC for 25 percent less money. Now that her tenure at Fox has ended and her new show is scheduled to start production sequences for a fall premiere, Kelly decided she wasnt happy and demanded the format be changed.\n\nAccording to Hugh McGovern, executive producer of Kellys new show:\n\nMegyn had high hopes when she left Fox that people would still take her seriously as a journalist. She was lured to NBC with promises of easier days and evenings at home with the family. Now that she sees the production schedule, she feels like shes been duped and has demanded she be given more serious show assignments.\n\nThe problem, according to McGovern, is that Kelly sees a schedule filled with visits from celebrities and novelists to talk about their sitcoms and books, traveling assignments to dog shows and fashion week and even the addition of a musical guest. According to Maxwell Seawald, CEO of NBC Universal:\n\nMs. Kelly wants to be a journalist. Unfortunately, after her stint at Fox News and the way she attacked President Trump, she lost her following. Our data tells us that our audience will tolerate and even learn to like her, but not as a political pundit or someone they should take seriously. She needs to think less Diane Sawyer and more Kelly Ripa.\n\nUnfortunately, Kelly couldnt do that and the whole thing came to a head this afternoon, causing NBC to pay a severance clause of $150K to cancel her contract. NBC spokesman Hugh Levitt told Fox News:\n\nMegyn Kelly was a superstar until she took on Trump. Now shes a laughing stock. She could have worked a year or two and made herself $25 million. Instead shell spend her days looking for someone else who needs a washed up hasbeen from Fox News who knows nothing but how to piss people off.\n\nSorry, Megyn.

"b'NASA Will Pay You $18,000 To Stay In Bed And Smoke Weed For 70 Straight Days'","b'We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though its a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.\n\nIf youre one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than youre prepared for.\n\nNASA has put out an ad looking for people whore willing to take part in their Rest Studies  a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.\n\nSo what is the exact purpose of these studies?\n\nThese studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.\n\nThe Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.\n\nThis study is designed to achieve three core tasks:\n\nExamining how the astronauts changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.\n\nExamining if the astronauts physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.\n\nPreparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.\n\nThe studys participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.\n\nThe exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether youre in the exercising or non-exercising group.\n\nOnce the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days youll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days youll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! Youll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.\n\nDuring the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your bodys immunity system.\n\nBut is it worth it?\n\nYou may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you cant take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.\n\nThis will probably be your only opportunity to say that youve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.'",F

b'Confirmed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is RESIGNING From The Post of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court',"b'If this is true it will mean an opening for another Conservative Justice to be appointed by President Trump.\r\n\r\nShe said she will resign if Trump was elected President, and now when he got elected, and with a month until the inauguration, she will be resigning.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November. Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices, she seemed uneasy at the thought.\r\n\r\nI DONT WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY, BUT IF IT SHOULD BE, THEN EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS, SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW THAT ALSO TOUCHED ON THE LOSS OF HER DEAR FRIEND ANTONIN SCALIA AND SOME OF THE COURTS BIGGEST RULINGS IN THE TERM THAT ENDED IN LATE JUNE.\r\n\r\nI REALLY DISLIKE THAT MAN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT FORTH MY PERSONAL VIEWS BECAUSE OF MY POSITION, I STILL FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN ORDER TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THERES STILL TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE, SHE ADDED.\r\n\r\nDONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO HAS ACCUMULATED HIS VAST WEALTH NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS PROWESS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER.

b'Rape Victims Should Be In Custody If There Is Suspicion That Theyre Planning Abortion',"b'At a campaign town hall event at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with radical positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.\n\nI dont know what youre talking  I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. Thats what I believe, declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. I believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process thats been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal, Rubio asserted.\n\n\n\nTaking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would put rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.\n\nIm just totally against the whole shebang, I wont deny it, Rubio said. I am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesnt mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what its father has done to you, come on.\n\nHe added: That is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.\n\nAsked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: Dont know yet, first things first here. I need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better./SOURCE\n\nComments\n\ncomments'",F

According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:\n\nPresident Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.\n\nRyans office has asserted that he can not be fired by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:\n\nSpeaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trumps statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.\n\nRelate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesnt say things he doesnt mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.\n\nThis isnt about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:\n\nMr. SpeakerYoure fired.\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that.""",F

b'Hateful Arizona Pastor Deported From Botswana After Saying Gays Should Be Stoned to Death (VIDEO)',"b'Wouldnt it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, thats exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.\n\nAndersons road to Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a roundabout way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere.\n\nI have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The countrys Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana)  and if youve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his thing. The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a prohibited immigrant:\n\nPastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana  Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016\n\nWhat prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be stoned to death. Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesnt advocate violence, the victims were disgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.\n\nAnderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesnt believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), if it did then yes I would condone it because the Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.\n\nIn the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the countrys acceptance of f*ggots, has called the Orlando massacre good news because a bunch of f*ggots died (he later expanded on that by adding that perfect Christians would bathe in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jenners heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world to cure AIDS.\n\nYou can watch Anderson getting snagged by immigration officials below.

From Politico:\n\nIn a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address violence in the black community and black-on-black crime. Trump responded by proposing that stop-and-frisk policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically, Trump told the questioner.\n\nStop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management.\n\nWhen the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadnt done anything wrong.\n\nFormer US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as destructive in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added:\n\nIn short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.\n\nFeatured image via Flickr'",R

Dont even read further if you are part of the mans best friend club, you just might regret your decision to get out of bed this morning. News just hit the web that the locally famous three year-old dog named Loung, who fell out of a truck last year, landing on a busy route between Cambodia and Thailand, has been hit and killed by a car as it waited for the return of its owner for over a year.\n\nYou can start the waterworks as we go into the details. The Sukhumvit Road, or Thailand Route 3, is a leading highway between Bangkok and Cambodia and Loungs owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck. Whats truly amazing is that the dog refused to leave the area, hoping that one day her owner would return and rescue her.\n\n 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

After some time had passed, Loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog.\n\nMany people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be Loungs true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.\n\nLoung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. That distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. The story has been going viral ever since.\n\nA dog lovers club in Thailand has donated money for the funeral expenses of Lounghoping to give a proper burial for such a loyal animal.""",R

b'The Word Liberals are TERRIFIED Of  Eagle Rising',"b'Terrorism is terrorism, regardless of the source, and two American cities felt the sting of it over the weekend. Is it really that hard to say?

b'Trump received $1.6 million from Secret Service',"b'Donald Trump\'s campaign isn\'t alone in patronizing his own businesses: taxpayers are indirectly doing so, too.\n\nFederal Election Commission records show that the U.S. Secret Service has paid the Trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIts standard practice for the agency  which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials  to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates.\n\nIn fact, the Secret Service has reimbursed the Clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle.\n\nThe difference with Trump is that one of his companies, TAG Air, Inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him.\n\nThe Clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called Executive Fliteways in which the Clintons do not have any ownership interest.\n\nThe taxpayers are actually reimbursing Trump for the travel of the Secret Service agents,"" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm Akerman LLP. ""It\'s just another example of how the Trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at Trump-owned facilities.""\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to questions about the Secret Service payments by saying everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.\n\nSecret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC specifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seats on charter aircraft.\n\nA POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August, Trumps campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump\'s own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower.\n\nBut the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc.\n\nTrump, who once said I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it, has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets.\n\nThe campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as misleading and flat out wrong, pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump\'s businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign.\n\nThe statement explained the campaigns payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.\n\nThe government\'s practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn\'t have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission.\n\n""It\'s basically just calling it even,"" Engle said. ""It\'s either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses.""\n\nThe same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. So its conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane.\n\nThe Secret Service could also end up paying Trump\'s hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don\'t appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly.\n\nThe agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund.\n\nOf course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August, Trumps campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.\n\n\n\nAuthors:'",R
b'WWII Veteran Pens Brutal Op-Ed Slamming Draft-Dodging Trump',"b'7.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nA ninety-six-year-old World War II veteran and longtime New Yorker contributor Roger Angell has voted in eighteen elections. As he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience  and sends a dire warning to the American people.\n\nThis man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, believes that the election of Republican nominee Donald Trump would be a catastrophe on the same level:\n\nMy country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the Axis powers held most of Continental Europe, and Imperial Japan controlled the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. \n\nAngell acknowledges Trumps long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the Second World War, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought.\n\nI stick at a different momentthe lighthearted comment he made when, in early August, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his Purple Heart and Mr. Trump said, I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier. Mr. Trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? This is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young Americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. I take this personally, representing as I do the last sliver of the sixteen million Americans who served in the military in my warI experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. I have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend Gardner, an infantry captain who landed at Normandy Beach and fought at Hrtgen Forest and Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge, was twice woundedmy late brother-in-law Neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of Belfort Gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. Every American of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war.\n\nFar too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict  or never learned them at all, as in Trumps case. Trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young Americans who perished in the jungles of Vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once theyve served their purpose.\n\nTrump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle  negatives that deeply disturb Mr. Angell.\n\nMr. Trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. He is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, How will I look? This is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only the narcissists mirror for reassurance.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Angell has glowing praise for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the Presidency:\n\nI will cast my own vote for Hillary Clinton with alacrity and confidence. From the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. She is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. Her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. Ms. Clinton will make a strong and resolute Presidentat last, a female leader of our ownand, in the end, perhaps a unifying one.\n\nHe saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a President Trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the White House:\n\nIf Donald Trump wins this election, his nights in the White House will very soon resemble those of President Obama. A new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of bad newsanother police shooting out West, another suicide bomber in Yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in the mornings difficult events. He needs to respond, but the beginning of this Presidents response is always reliably at hand: How will I look?\n\nWe absolutely cannot elect a President that will put his own public image above the needs of the American people.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

"b'Muslim Afghani Rapes 2-YEAR-OLD, Gets 2 Years in PrisonDeclares Himself Superstar  Eagle Rising'","b'A 22-year-old Muslim man from Afghanistan proudly declared that he was a superstar in Afghanistan after he sodomized and orally raped a 2-year-old boy. The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nThe UKs Express reports:\n\nJama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThe toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into the childs mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles.\n\nDuring the trial Jama B. boasted: Im a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.\n\n\n\nJudge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child.\n\nTherefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. Hes better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.\n\n\n\nJama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime.\n\nA second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence.\n\nProsecutor Axel Bieler said, Rape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case.\n\nTherefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penalty doesnt matter  it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.\n\nSay what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure.\n\nKarin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, The court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused.\n\nThe fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence, she added. He is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.\n\nWhats even worse is the comments by the familys attorney.\n\nIt was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child, Peter Boysen said. Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. Hes better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.\n\nReally, Mr. Boysen? How about if this was your little boy? Would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? I think not.\n\nGermans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing.\n\nThe incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court, wrote the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. This is the verdict that shames you all.\n\nPeople continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough. Excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of Muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire.\n\nDont think it wont be happening in the united States either. Our own military kicked out Sgt. Charles Martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in Afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. Do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when theyve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? I think not.\n\nIn a biblical society, this man would have been put to death, and rightly so.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",R

b'Trump Gets ANNIHILATED On Twitter After He Pretends He Didnt Just Trash Police Officers (TWEETS)',"b'On Monday, Donald Trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching Ahmad Khan Rahami, who was responsible for the Saturday bombing in New York City.\n\nThis would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadnt been a contradiction of something Trump had said just a few minutes before. Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media  and they didnt hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for Rahamis capture, hed dissed the NYPD for allowing political correctness to interfere with catching terrorists. Among the first to point this out was MSNBCs Christopher Hayes, who tweeted:\n\nHayes was referring to a disrespectful comment Trump had made on Fox and Friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said:\n\nYou know, our police are amazing, our local police. They know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they dont want to be accused of profiling, and they dont want to be accused of all sorts of things.\n\nYup  Trump had accused the NYPD of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. Other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the Republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced:\n\nThis tweet was particularly funny, and Im sure there will be some backlash for Trump to deal with:\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign, Trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than African American police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a law and order candidate. But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.\n\nFeatured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images'",R
"b'McConnell, Pelosi, Ryan seek deal on government funding impasse'","b'AP Photo McConnell, Pelosi, Ryan seek deal on government funding impasse A total of $170 million for the Flint water crisis is added to the WRDA bill.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the Sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches.\n\nIn a series of three-way discussions on Tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until Dec. 9. In turn, Republicans would provide an ""iron-clad commitment"" that funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, will be included in the Water Resources Development Act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLate Tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: Pelosi and Ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for Flint.\n\n""The amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to WRDA as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding Flint needs in the final WRDA conference report,"" a Pelosi aide said late Tuesday night. The water resources legislation could head to the House floor as early as Wednesday.\n\nPelosi and other Democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a CR, to keep the government open without the Flint funding. Ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up GOP votes for a short-term funding bill.\n\nWith Ryan and Pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. McConnell and Pelosi had also held discussions on the Flint-WRDA issue, said GOP and Democratic sources. McConnell had been pushing to include Flint funding in the WRDA package. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had been making his own insistence for Flint aid clear with Republicans.\n\nEarlier, Senate Republicans had been considering stripping Louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved Senate Democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. That proposal had come after Democrats voted Tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure  which would keep the government open until Dec. 9  because the package provides money for Louisiana and other states but did nothing to address Flint.\n\nMcConnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no Louisiana disaster relief, one senior GOP leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican floated the idea at a news conference Tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold.\n\n""We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods,"" McConnell said. ""That\'s certainly an option worth discussing.""\n\nInformed of that comment, Reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what McConnell would do, and again said Democrats wanted relief for both Louisiana and Flint.\n\nBut other Democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. ""If Louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. And that would be helpful, said Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin.\n\nThere\'s still really deep felt feelings by our Michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in Flint and we don\'t trust the House to help at all, Durbin added.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer also said Democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. I doubt that we would turn that down, he told reporters. Hoyer said Democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, which has long been stalled on Capitol Hill. The measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a July law to curb prescription opioid addiction.\n\nSenate Republicans had argued that the proper place for Flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through Congress. The Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month.\n\nWhy do you feel as if you have to punish people in Louisiana who are digging out from a flood  sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out  for Flint when theres a pathway forward on Flint through the WRDA bill? argued GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of Louisiana.\n\nStill, despite vows from some Senate Republicans that Flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the House and Senate in a lame duck session, Democrats had been skeptical.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the Securities and Exchange Commissions ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. But that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over Flint.\n\nMcConnell and Reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. If the Senate is able to pass a funding bill, the House would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly.\n\nAmong the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four Democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, as well as Bill Nelson of Florida, where the Zika virus is spreading quickly.\n\nThirteen Republicans joined most Democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, and South Carolinas Lindsey Graham. Cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body. Graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank.\n\nHeather Caygle, Rachael Bade and Annie Snider contributed to this story.\n\nAuthors:'",R

This whole countys very, very patriotic.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often gonehistory is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.\n\nBut for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolinas flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monuments223than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the New South and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and its a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.\n\nThough a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governors decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginias southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansionknown as the Last Capitol of the ConfederacyConfederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.\n\nThat rulingalong with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the stateprompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. If you eliminate these monuments and memorials, youre taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the countryto learn the good, the bad and ugly, Poindexter says.\n\nMany of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.\n\nEvery little statues a part of a much larger discussion and movement, says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. African-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that theyre using it for.\n\n***\n\nMark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. My ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity, Whitaker says.\n\nNow, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. These monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people, he says.\n\nMany of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.\n\nBut even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouths monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. We believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth, Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so there has been protection all along.\n\nWhen the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.\n\nBack in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents dont want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monumenta position Whitaker finds ridiculous. Why now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, were concerned about cost?\n\nHe says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. Were on solid legal grounds to remove it, he says. We just need four votes.\n\n***\n\nOther Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the citys entire historic landscape.\n\nHe asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville by telling the full story of race through our public spaces. The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December.\n\nIn the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic sitethe place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.\n\nBlack Lives Matter is spray painted on a monument to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond, Virginia, in June 2015. | AP Photo\n\nRichmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. Its also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled Black Lives Matter on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaderssuch as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. Rather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginias history, Jones said in a statement last summer.\n\nDelegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although hes fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, Its far better than tearing down the current ones.\n\nIn his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is irrelevant. They need to be respected, he says. They didnt know what we know today. Thats why these monuments are important.\n\nAyers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. The white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States, he says. Theyve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. Its an amalgam of power and weakness.\n\nTheyre meant to do work, Ayers says. The work that they were meant to do, in some ways theyre still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.\n\n***\n\nIn Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls The War Between the States. Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.\n\nOne of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, we just dont have a copy of the actual check.\n\nPoindexter says Franklin County lost hundreds of its best men in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was a horrible process that had a big impact on the region.\n\nToday, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an A rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the states median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexters efforts to save war monuments. We didnt want anybody pulling any monuments down, Stanley says.\n\nSoon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the countys Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.\n\nCivil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginias Blue Ridge. To be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.\n\nYet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the societys website, Special emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.\n\nConfederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and hes known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. He became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history, says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace.\n\nSpeaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isnt ready to surrender, either. He doesnt know whether hell propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasnt ruled it out. If you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop? he says. You cant change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.\n\nLisa Rab is a journalist in Charlotte, N.C.

"b""Obama, in an awkward twist, becomes Saudi Arabia's defender""","b'President Barack Obama has never had a great relationship with Saudi Arabia.\n\nNow, hes the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama has cast the Saudis as ""so-called"" allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of Islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich Arab state learn to ""share"" the Middle East with rival Iran. The Saudis, meanwhile, consider Obama naive, sparring with him over the Iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach to Syrias bloody civil war.\n\nDespite these differences, Obama has promised to veto a bill that Congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nThat Obama and Riyadh find themselves on the same side against Congress underscores the bizarre evolution of U.S.-Saudi ties over the past eight years. An alliance once unquestioned in Washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism, but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards.\n\n""This is clearly a relationship in transition,"" said Jon Alterman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Nobody really has a sense of what theyre trying to transition it to.""\n\nJust how tricky is the relationship? Two more examples: Obama is supporting the Saudis in their fight against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, even though U.S. officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the Islamic State. And many of the same U.S. lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the Saudis just this week green-lit a $1.15 billion arms sale to the country. ""Does no one sense the irony? asked Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the Senate.\n\nThe back and forth in Washington is ""schizophrenic behavior"" that has deeply frustrated leaders in the Middle East for years, said a former senior U.S. official deeply familiar with the Arab world.\n\nCongress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The Saudis, through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists, have tried hard to stop it, waging a major PR effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdom\'s efforts to stop terrorists. The Saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the U.S. has never found proof of it, either. The Saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in U.S. assets to protect themselves against lawsuits.\n\nAdministration officials downplay the idea that Obama will veto the bill merely to protect Saudi Arabia. Normally, U.S. citizens aren\'t allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity. Obama\'s concern, officials say, thus goes well beyond the Saudis; he\'s worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the U.S. to be sued over its actions abroad.\n\n""To pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even American businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a recent press briefing.\n\nThe perception in many quarters, however, is that Obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001, were Saudi nationals. And the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 9/11 attacks raised more questions about Saudi government ties to Islamist extremists.\n\n""We are disappointed that the president is not standing with us,"" said Mindy Kleinberg, who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers Thursday to push for a veto override. ""We have been waiting a very long time for justice, and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability.""\n\nWhatever his motivation, Obama\'s decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease Saudi suspicions.\n\nThe Saudis\' wariness of Obama has its roots in his comments in 2002, well before he ran for president, referring to the monarchy in Riyadh as a so-called ally. It grew after Obama sided against Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring movements, leading Saudi royals to question whether America would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own.\n\nIt deepened in 2013, after Obama decided not to stage a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is despised by the Saudis, even after Assad apparently crossed Obama\'s ""red line"" by using chemical weapons. And it reached a new peak in 2015 after Obama struck a nuclear deal with Iran, a Shiite theocracy that Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia views as a growing threat in the Middle East.\n\nStill, Obama, cognizant of the need for the U.S. to maintain alliances with stable countries in the Middle East, has otherwise tried hard to allay Saudi concerns. He cut short a trip to India to rush to see the newly crowned Saudi king, Salman, in January 2015, after the previous monarch died. He also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the Saudis, in part to assuage Saudi concerns about the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nBut earlier this year, in comments to the Atlantic magazine that infuriated the Saudis, Obama appeared to reverse decades of U.S. policy that tilted heavily toward Riyadh and against Tehran.\n\nThe competition between the Saudis and the Iranians  which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen  requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace, Obama said.\n\nPrince Turki Al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that Obama had ""thrown us a curve ball"" and criticizing the president for saying Americas Gulf allies were free riders wholly dependent on the U.S. for their security.\n\nAnd in April, weeks after the Atlantic piece was published, Saudi Arabia appeared to snub Obama when he visited Riyadh for a summit by sending a lower-level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state TV. The readouts from those meetings in Riyadh also suggested the president hadn\'t done much to assuage Saudi concerns, with the two sides saying they\'d ""discussed"" and ""exchanged views"" more than agreeing on anything.\n\nThe president also hosted Saudi Arabias deputy crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, when he visited Washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving the kingdoms image in Washington. Obama made sure to praise the prince\'s plan to transform the Saudi economy, dubbed Vision 2030. He also tried to reassure the Saudi royal that the U.S. will back the Saudis against interference by Iran, which remains an official enemy of the United States.\n\nBut some constants in the U.S.-Saudi relationship have turned into variables, meaning that even after Obama leaves office in just a few months, the alliance could prove rocky.\n\nThe low price of oil, for example, is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy; the U.S. also relies more now on its own energy reserves, reducing Americas addiction to Saudi oil. Some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia  women, though still facing severe segregation, make up a growing share of the workforce; young people are more exposed than ever to the Internet and the outside world; and thousands of Saudis educated in the U.S. are now capitalizing on that experience in their country.\n\nBy all accounts, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia still maintain a strong security relationship, and U.S. officials privately say the Saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule. U.S. officials also say the Saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their Islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant.\n\n""The close cooperation on countering violent extremists like [the Islamic State], the continued Saudi preference for American arms, the important role that Saudi Arabia plays in international energy markets and the $70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future,"" said Fahad Nazer, a former political analyst with the Saudi Embassy in Washington who now does similar work for JTG Inc.\n\nIn many ways, what Obama thinks about the Saudis matters less and less as his time in the Oval Office draws to an end. But while the Saudis will be happy to see him leave, there\'s great uncertainty in Riyadh about how the next president will deal with them.\n\nBoth Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have voiced grave concerns about Saudi Arabia\'s track record of producing Islamic extremists; Clinton has said she supports the 9/11 lawsuit bill. But while Clinton would likely be a more predictable partner, the Saudis see Trump  who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States  as a wild card.\n\nFor now, however, the Saudis are nervously watching Congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them.\n\nAlready, some members of Congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 9/11 legislation after all, and that they may consider voting to uphold Obama\'s veto. Their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs, including the European Union, voice opposition to the bill. The original bill passed on voice vote in both Houses, making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record. And with the presidential election looming, the politics are even more fraught than normal.\n\nSaudi Arabia has never been an especially popular actor in Washington  a powerful one, but not popular,"" the former senior U.S. official said. ""And now, nobody in Congress wants to stick their neck out for the Saudis two-and-a-half months before the presidential election.\n\nAuthors:'",R

Just six weeks after he dropped out  and more than a month before Cruz would dramatically snub the nominee at the Republican National Convention  the senator quietly began renting his vast donor email file to his former rival, pocketing at least tens of thousands of dollars, and more likely hundreds of thousands, that can be used to bankroll the Texans own political future. ... [A]n email rate sheet obtained by POLITICO shows that Cruz asks campaigns to pay more than $22,000 for the right to send a single email his list of 280,000 digital donors. He charges more than $51,000 to ping his full email file of 1.28 million supporters. http://politi.co/2dvr5KK\n\nREMEMBERING ARNOLD PALMER -- Arnold Palmer, the Magnetic Face of Golf in the 60s, Dies at 87, by NYTs Dave Anderson: Arnold Palmer, the champion golfer whose full-bore style of play, thrilling tournament victories and magnetic personality inspired an American golf boom, attracted a following known as Arnies Army and made him one of the most popular athletes in the world, died on Sunday, according to a spokesman for his business enterprises.

Trump struck a very different tone on Sunday, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would recognize an undivided Jerusalem as Israels eternal capital and squarely blaming Palestinian hatred and violence for the ongoing failure of Middle East peace efforts.\n\nNot to be outdone, in her own meeting with Netanyahu a few hours later, Clinton told the Israeli leader that she opposes, in the words of a senior campaign aide, any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.  The two get-togethers spotlighted the U.S.-Israel relationship on the eve of the first presidential debate and likely drew the close attention of Jewish American voters. They also prompted complaints from Trump critics that Netanyahu was legitimizing Trump on the world stage. http://politi.co/2dvqQz7\n\nNYT EDITORIAL BOARD, part II -- Why Donald Trump Should Not Be President: Donald Trump is a man who dwells in bigotry, bluster and false promises: When Donald Trump began his improbable run for president 15 months ago, he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about Mexican rapists flooding across the Southern border. From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trumps views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims. http://nyti.ms/2cP5lpd\n\nAIR WARS -- Coal industry mounts unusual court-focused ad campaign, by Josh Gerstein: For the past few weeks, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesdays oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the D.C.

In mid-July Politico reported that Mr. Ailes had once talked about dispatching thugs to beat up Mr. Sherman. It is unclear how serious he was. But now that Mr. Ailes had lost his job, it seemed possible that he would also lose his famously volatile temper. So Mr. Sherman and the editors at New York hired some muscle. ...\n\n[I]n the summer of 2012, [Sherman's wife] spotted a black sport utility vehicle at the bottom of the driveway at a house in Vermont that she and Mr. Sherman had rented. The place was on a dead-end dirt road, in a tiny town where pickup trucks are the norm. When Ms. Stahl started walking toward the vehicle, it pulled into the driveway of a neighbor, who wasn't home. Who was in this car was never known, though Mr. Sherman assumed it was an Ailes operative.

b'BREAKING: Hollywood Legend Just Died Of Terrible Disease',"b'Hollywood loses yet another one of their dearest actresses, and we are heartbroken.\n\nShe was born in Chicago Illinois on December 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. Many of you probably remember the legendary actress as Liesl Von Trapp from The Sound of Music. Charmian Carr definitely left an imprint on Hollywood, and she will never be forgotten.\n\nTMZ reported the death of the 73-year-old on Sunday September 18, 2016. Carrs rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. Apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.\n\nCarrs story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. At the time that she auditioned for The Sound of Music she was a student at the San Fernando Valley State College. She was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor.\n\nI was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. One of the girls who modeled with me knew that Robert Wise, producer-director of The Sound of Music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old Liesl. My friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that I sang and danced. I received a call from Mr. Wise to come for a tryout. It took me completely by surprise\n\nAfter completing The Sound of Music and several other acting parts, Carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. Charmian started her own interior design business Charmian Carr Designs and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected  especially after being hired by Michael Jackson.\n\nCarr married Jay Brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. They had two beautiful daughters together. She is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren.\n\nShe brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. Her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. Please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one.\n\nI cant help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!\n\nRIP CHARMIAN CARR.'",R
b'Trump Silent As Police Credit A Sikh Immigrant With Capturing NYC Bomber',"b'55.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nOnce again, Donald Trump and the Republican Partys fear-mongering about immigrants is proven false. Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points  vilifying Syrian refugees. These attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th.\n\nHe later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: Think of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. Its sickness, and its hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen  and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw the mans face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do.\n\nHe called the cops.\n\nI did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the same thingIm from Sikh faith. Ive been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution said Bains to CNNs Chris Cuomo.\n\nHes absolutely right  because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees because theyre Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\nThe chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. Bains actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would.\n\nFor instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of Mateens radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and his campaigns racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America  not refugee or immigrants.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!'",R
"b""Former Miss Universe sizes up Melania Trump: 'I think I speak more English'""","b""Both women are former models, but Alicia Machado attacked Melania Trump for failing to do more to help those around her as the wife of a prominent political figure. | Getty Former Miss Universe sizes up Melania Trump: 'I think I speak more English'\n\nAlicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who vaulted into the political spotlight Monday night as the latest example of Donald Trumps derogatory remarks about women, said the GOP nominees wife, Melania, is a decoration with limited English-speaking skills.\n\nIn an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine published Tuesday, Machado drew a clear line between her own immigration story and that of Melania Trump. Both women are former models, but Machado attacked Melania Trump for failing to do more to help those around her as the wife of a prominent political figure.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nI think I speak more English than her, Machado said. I dont see anything about this girl. Shes a doll. Shes a decoration. That is how I see her.\n\nDonald Trump was harshly critical of Machado during her tenure as Miss Universe, calling her Miss Piggy and Miss Housekeeping, the latter a reference to her Hispanic heritage. Machado told Cosmopolitan that those remarks triggered a relapse of her bulimia that took several years to escape.\n\nMachado, who was also crowned Miss Venezuela, became an American citizen in August, something she told Cosmopolitan she did specifically to vote against Trump.\n\nTuesday morning, Trump admitted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had gotten under his skin a little bit by bringing up Machado at the debate. He said the pageant winner gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.\n\nThat person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe, Trump said on Fox News Fox & Friends. She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa, and it wasnt quite that way, but thats OK. Hillary has to do what she has to do.\n\nAuthors:""",R
"b""BREAKING: North Carolina Drops Anti-LGBT 'Bathroom Bill' Lawsuit Against US""","b'North Carolina\'s governor has dropped a lawsuit asking a federal court to preserve the state\'s HB2 law limiting civil rights protections for LGBT people and regulating who uses which public bathrooms.\r\n\r\nIn court documents Friday, Gov. Pat McCrory cited ""substantial costs to the State"" as one reason for dropping his lawsuit against the federal government, writing that it did not serve the ""interests of judicial economy and efficiency.""\r\n\r\n\r\nBusinesses, performing artists and event organizers have boycotted the state since House Bill 2 was passed. In July, the NBA announced it was pulling its February All-Star Game out of Charlotte, saying in a statement, ""We do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by the current law.""\r\n\r\nThis month, the NCAA and the Atlantic Coast Conference both moved championship sporting events out of the state.\r\n\r\nMcCrory sued the federal government in May, after U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said HB2 violated both the Civil Rights Act and Title IX and threatened to withhold federal funding to the state. The Department of Justice countersued, seeking to ban enforcement on the grounds that the law is, as Lynch said at the time, ""impermissibly discriminatory.""\r\n\r\nDid You Know It\'s Legal In Most States To Discriminate Against LGBT People?\r\nIT\'S ALL POLITICS\r\nDid You Know It\'s Legal In Most States To Discriminate Against LGBT People?\r\nNorth Carolina Passes Law Blocking Measures To Protect LGBT People\r\nTHE TWO-WAY\r\nNorth Carolina Passes Law Blocking Measures To Protect LGBT People\r\n""This action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms.

That suit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, was filed in March on behalf of Joaquin Carcao, a 27-year-old transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is banned from using public men\'s restrooms under the law.\r\n\r\nSome local support for the law is waning, as well. After months of bad business news and widespread condemnation by other state governments, at least two state legislators who helped pass the law now want it repealed.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina state Sens. Tamara Barringer and Rick Gunn have both backed off their initial support for the law. Barringer says she voted for the law out of concern about ""safety and particularly privacy in bathrooms."" But last week, she told NPR she has changed her mind:\r\n\r\n""There\'s several factors that have changed my mind. It is having a tremendous adverse economic impact on the families of North Carolina. These are jobs. These are the way we support our families, the way we fund education.\r\n\r\n""It is also creating the wrong impression of North Carolinians in the world or across the nation. Last week, I had the privilege of representing North Carolina on an education mission to Arizona State University.\r\n\r\n""But at lunch, someone asked the question, \'Senator Barringer, what is this HB2 thing?\' And that really caught me in my tracks, that, all the way across the country, someone is asking this.\r\n\r\n""And then, finally, the other thing that has galvanized me is we have talked hundreds of hours... since April about HB-2. And yes, it is an important issue, but we need to move on to the business of North Carolina.""\r\n\r\nMcCrory has said he still stands by the ideas in the law, which makes it illegal for local governments in the state to pass laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination. But his office said last week that the governor would repeal the law if the city of Charlotte repeals a local ordinance protecting LGBT people from discrimination, according to the Charlotte Observer.\r\n\r\nThat local ordinance, which never took effect because the state law overruled it, would have prevented businesses from discriminating against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Charlotte, and allowed people to use the locker rooms and bathrooms corresponding to the gender with which they identify.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina Sues DOJ Over LGBT Law; DOJ Sues Back \r\nTHE TWO-WAY\r\nNorth Carolina Sues DOJ Over LGBT Law; DOJ Sues Back\r\nThe Charlotte City Council considered such a repeal in May, but it was voted down. The city\'s mayor, Jennifer Roberts, said the issue of whether to repeal the ordinance will not be on the agenda when the city council meets Monday evening.\r\n\r\nWhile city leaders ""applaud the governor for recognizing the state should overturn HB2,"" Roberts wrote in a statement Monday, she argued that Charlotte does not bear responsibility for the state law, noting the state Legislature can overturn it ""at any time without any action from the City of Charlotte.""'",R
"b'America Just Tragically Lost A Country Music Icon, Please Pray For Jean Shepards Family'","b""We are absolutely heartbroken to hear about the death of someone that was so special to everyone in country music.\n\nShe always had a smile on her face and she lit up any room that she walked into.

Voting has already started in a scattering of locations, and entire states will be able to vote starting Friday.\n\nElection Day is more than a month away, but voters are already casting ballots to pick their next president.\n\nVoting opened on Monday in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, making the town's voters among the first in the nation to do so. So far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. On Friday, however, voters statewide in South Dakota and Minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots. And other states are joining soon: New Jersey starts early voting on Saturday, and Vermont plans to start early voting as soon as the ballots are ready. (State rules say no later than Saturday.)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. Some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election.

b'Worst. President. Ever.',"b'As my 25th wedding anniversary approached, I tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife. I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were largeup until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.\n\nOh, the Panic of 1857, the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. It was really bad. The president didnt seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNow that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility thatwhoever the winner ishe or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.\n\nBut Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly wont rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was. Ive made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, lets say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaquesstopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldnt be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.\n\nBuchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.\n\nStart with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of Americas great financial downturns.\n\nFor a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent.\n\nThen the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroadBuchanan wanted to stimulate foreign tradebut made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.\n\nThree days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled.\n\nScott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good.\n\nBuchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.\n\nIgnoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.\n\nLegend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate thatand that he would be all for whatever the court decided.\n\nTwo days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.\n\nHistorically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in the courts history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the countrywith not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it.\n\nAs appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.\n\nThousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he ownedhis stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless.\n\nEvery bank in New York City effectively closednone would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co.\n\nBuchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.\n\nThe residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity.\n\nYet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.\n\nBuchanans response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and deserved the gamblers fate. Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.\n\nIn a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.\n\nThroughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid.\n\nIn other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary William Walkers forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatalexcept to one pigbattle. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be.\n\nAs the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plain didnt like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election.\n\nThe Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between Lincolns election and his inauguration in March, thus under Buchanans watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.\n\nAs the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinet membershe had a lot of Southern alliesand refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter.\n\nEnter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the Worst. President. Ever, there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb.\n\nToday, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of 08 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. But as happened with Honest Abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump to shine.\n\nRobert Strauss is author of the forthcoming Worst.

"b'Trump Said Not Paying Taxes Makes Him ""Smart."" Mark Cuban\'s Response Is Powerful'","b'72k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThe first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.\n\nInstead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.\n\nThere is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was no bigger jagoff in the world.\n\nThe indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets  that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.\n\nClinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clintons hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, That makes me smart. Trumps cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.\n\nAn hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , It sounds like you admitted you havent paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say? Trump replied, No, I didnt say that at all.\n\nTrump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:\n\nI get audited every year my taxes are  it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of  do what the law recommends. But Im not against paying taxes. And Ill give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didnt do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. Im, Im the luckiest guy in the world. Theres nobody whos been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country thats been great to us. And you cant just take, take, take, take, take, take.\n\n.@mcuban on Trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/uPNunatukV  Stefan Becket (@becket) September 27, 2016\n\nThe contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.\n\nTrump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trumps world there is a two-tiered system.

b'Trump Jr. Once Again Shows His Lack Of Humanity With Disgusting Tweet About Syrian Refugees',"b""Weve all seen the horrific photos of children who are victims of the Syrian Civil War. Perhaps the most infamous is the one of the little boy sitting, covered in blood and dirt, barefoot, in the back of an ambulance. He is clearly in shock. It shows us just what that kind of war does to a society, to ordinary people, and children just like us, just like the kids in our own lives.\n\nWell, there is one person who is completely unmoved by these images: Donald Trump Jr. The Donalds mini me has long shown his lack of humanity. After all, he made a disgusting Holocaust reference when trying to tear down the medias coverage of Hillary Clinton, saying if the GOP did what the Democrats are doing, theyd be warming up the gas chamber. Well, now, hes gone into the gutter again, this time regarding Syrian refugees. Trump Jr sent out the following tweet, comparing refugees to a bowl of Skittles:\n\nThis image says it all.

She went on to say:\n\nSkittles are candy. Refugees are people. We dont feel its an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.\n\nThe Trump campaign is so repugnant that even candy makers have to speak out.

Ltd., its majority owner and three of its managers are charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations. They are also charged with attempting to defraud the United States and conspiring to engage in international money laundering.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe charges arise from financial transactions using U.S. dollars between Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation, which is under both U.S. and UN sanctions. Those transactions, according to the Justice Department, were conducted both by Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development as well as by numerous front companies that it controlled.\n\nThe Justice Department also announced a civil complaint, seeking the civil forfeiture of all the money held in the 25 Chinese bank accounts of Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and its front corporations. Those accounts are subject to forfeiture, the Justice Department said, because they received hundreds of millions of dollars that arrived via the United States. Because the money was routed through the U.S., it falls under American jurisdiction, the department said.\n\nPressure has mounted on President Barack Obamas administration to crack down on China, North Koreas largest trading partner and international protector, since the isolated nations latest nuclear test earlier this month. Republicans and even Obamas own former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have urged the president to more forcefully pressure China to enforce international sanctions against North Korea.\n\nRep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) has specifically called on Obama to put to use the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, a law signed by the president earlier this year that affords his administration authority to sanction any individual who ""imports, exports, or re-exports luxury goods to or into North Korea"" or ""engages in money laundering, counterfeiting of goods or currency, bulk cash smuggling, or narcotics trafficking that supports the government of North Korea or its senior officials.""\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has blamed Clinton for North Koreas most recent nuclear launch. Jason Miller, Trumps senior communications adviser, labeled it one more example of Hillary Clinton\'s catastrophic failures as secretary of state,"" and added that ""Clinton promised to work to end North Koreas nuclear program as secretary of state, yet the program has only grown in strength and sophistication.""\n\nAuthors:'",R

(PolitiFact rated Romneys criticism half true, noting that Obama did say act of terror right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak consistently in the days that followed."")\n\nGiuliani took issue with Holt ignorantly attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul\'s false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War.\n\nA federal judge in New York ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as Holt suggested, Giuliani argued.\n\nThe thing thats wrong is Lester Holt said straight out: Stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. Lester Holt is not a lawyer, Giuliani said. Hes wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren.

[VIDEO]\n\nIt has been 15 years now that we have been fighting the War on Terror. While during George W. Bushs presidency, we had very few terrorist attacks on American soil. But since Barack Obama has been president, that has changed, especially over the last year. There have been shootings and bombings and yet Obama is refusing to change anything. After welcoming thousands of Muslim refugees from Syria, we saw an uptick in terrorist attacks yet, Obama has plans to allow over 110,000 more to enter the United States next year. They have to be Muslim, of course, because racial profiling is the worst thing anyone can do, ever! Well, according to Obama and his fellow liberals, anyway.\n\nBut thats exactly what we should be doing, according to KISS front man Gene Simmons. According to him, if we want to win the War on Terror, we need to start profiling everyone even him!\n\nCheck out the video below:\n\n 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nEveryone needs to get smart. Im okay with profiling, Simmons declared. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if Im clear, than profile someone else. Its emergency powers during war. Theres a war going on.\n\nBut its unfair, liberals will certainly cry. Simmons had a response to that, too. It is unfair, he said. Thats why the words too bad exist.\n\nIts kind of sad that the leader of a classic rock band has more common sense than liberal politicians do. Yes, profiling isnt nice. But being nice doesnt prevent terrorism. Profiling does  just look at Israel, which is surrounded by countries full of terrorists eager to literally wipe them off the map, yet theyre not only still there, theyre one of the strongest countries in the world. Somehow, profiling works well for them.\n\nMuslims are not all terrorists. We know that. But most terrorists in todays world are, in fact, Muslims. There is nothing wrong with taking a closer look at young Muslim men, for example, to ensure that they dont have ties to any terrorist organizations like ISIS. If they dont, then whats the problem?\n\nLiberals complain that profiling violates peoples constitutional rights, yet somehow, theyre perfectly fine with that when it comes to Second Amendment rights. Theyre all about gun control, because if it saves even one life, we should do it, even though it infringes upon our constitutional rights. Yet profiling is completely unacceptable? Get real, liberals. You make no sense.""",R
b'Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest',"b'Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest But he also presented himself as someone who could heal America\'s racial divide.\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on President Barack Obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a wounded country that looks bad to the world.\n\nPausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in Pittsburgh to address the Charlotte unrest, Trump also presented himself as the man to heal Americas racial divide.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBefore going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem, Trump said. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, and weve had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.\n\nHe called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding African-American families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a national crisis.\n\nHe also vowed to make American cities safer by appointing the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers and sympathized with police officers, who carry an immense responsibility but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. And he took a shot at Obamas leadership, or lack thereof.\n\nWe all have to walk a mile in someone elses shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean, its  we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country, Trump said. Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the worlds leader. How can we lead when we cant even control our own cities?\n\nTrump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th presidents responsibility to address this crisis and save African-American lives, has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign.\n\nTrump\'s overtures to black voters  often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences  have done little to dent Hillary Clinton\'s 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama\'s hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that drugs are a very, very big factor in what\'s happening in Charlotte.\n\nStill, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with Fox and Friends, the Republican presidential nominee said there just seems that theres a lack of spirit between the white and the black.\n\nI mean, its a terrible thing that were witnessing, he continued. Youre seeing it. I\'m seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte  a great place  and you just see it.\n\nProtests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte.\n\nBy Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott\'s family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott\'s family but did not commit to releasing it to the public.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Scotts family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of the familys lawyers, said the family\'s decision would depend on whether the video ""can somehow help us reach that truth.""\n\nJustin Bamberg, another of the familys attorneys, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that pictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources. He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed that Scotts wife was present when he was shot.\n\nAt the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood, Bamberg said when asked why the familys legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. Yes, we want transparency. We don\'t create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can\'t take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.\n\nThe Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the difficulties her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. I know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers, she said. But I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully.\n\nUnfortunately, we\'ve seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence, he said. We\'ve often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.\n\nWednesday\'s violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott\'s death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said.\n\nI see it even going out. Theres such a lack of  theres a lack of spirit, Trump said. Theres a lack of something. Somethings going on thats bad, and whats going on between police and others is getting worse.\n\nThe real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot.\n\nWell, its wow, here we go again, Trump said. Its very sad. When you look at whats going on, its very sad. Its very divided, our country, and its getting worse. Im not overly surprised to see it, but its happening.\n\nTrump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve wont solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more.\n\nIf you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue, Trump said. And they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was  that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, but theres something deeper than that.\n\nWhats necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from Americas current leader.\n\nWell, it really has to be  you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and theres no unity, Trump said. You look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. Its so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean, its so sad to see. But theres just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.\n\nBut what Trump didnt say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammed Obamas lack of leadership.\n\nFirst of all, its a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years after weve had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I think thats a tragic failure of leadership, Gingrich said.\n\nBut my guess is he was afraid itd make him a black president in a narrowing sense, he added. He could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.\n\nGiuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to last Fridays shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was a more difficult situation than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the ambiguous, troubling category.\n\nBut even there, you gotta say to people, Wait, let the investigation play out. The president of the United States should have said that yesterday, Giuliani said. The president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.\n\nAuthors:'",R

Because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. All police work is profiling. Discrimination does not mean prejudice; discrimination means telling un-like things apart\n\nWhat they do is they hire really smart people.

Were not talking about the rubber hose or sending you to a black site. I mean, I dont think this is too much of a sacrifice to ask.\n\nHes definitely right about the TSA. Their scanners and pat-down agents dont do anything to prevent terrorism. Not only has the TSA caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks, they have a 95% failure rate. That means, that theyll catch contraband roughly 5% of the time. The rest of the time, it gets through. Its a wonder that we havent dealt with another 9/11-style attack over the past 15 years.

Trump went on to add that when he becomes President, Ford would have to pay a 35 percent tax on any car they send back to the United States for sale.\n\nWow! Thats big news! Its also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN:\n\nIts really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.\n\nCNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico?

And thats the way it will continue to be.\n\nContinue reading below the advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFord has 85,000 workers in the United States, and that number has risen by 50 percent over the last five years.

"b'Clint Eastwood Had Enough, Blows Up On Hillary And Obama Liberals'","b'7.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nHollywood legend Clint Eastwood endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump while also expressing his lack of excitement for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He is after all a well known Hollywood conservative which is hard to come by.\n\nThe actor said Donald Trump is,\n\non to something because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. Thats the kiss-ass generation were in right now. Were really in a p***y generation. Everybodys walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff.\n\nHe went on,\n\nWhen I grew up, those things werent called racist, he continued. And then when I did Gran Torino even my associate said, This is a really good script, but its politically incorrect. And I said, Good. Let me read it tonight. The next morning, I came in and I threw it on his desk and I said, Were starting this immediately.\n\nWell tell us how you really feel Clint! It appears that perhaps, if even in the least bit, that Clint Eastwood and Donald Trump have something in common. They certainly have no filter. Eastwood did say in his statement that he believes Donald Trump occasionally steps out of line. Specifically Trumps comments about a Mexican judge being unfit to do his job because Trump made derogatory comments about Mexicans and he felt the judge would be prejudiced as a result. But he brushes it off as saying that Trump is simply stating what is on his mind.\n\nThe icon himself gave some advice for the future that he thinks could potentially make a difference,\n\nId say get to work and start being more understanding of everybodyinstead of calling everybody names, start being more understanding. But get in there and get it done. Kick ass and take names. And this may be my dad talking, but dont spend what you dont have. Thats why were in the position we are in right now. Thats why people are saying, Why should I work? Ill get something for nothing, maybe.\n\nHe has made headlines over some of his comments about the Republican nominee. When people called Donald Trump racist he proclaimed that people just needed to get over it already. He made sure to add a curse word in their for effect. One of his biggest criticisms of Hillary Clinton is her willingness to remain in the status quo which he detests. Which honestly is not entirely inaccurate.\n\nEastwoods political sentiments are contrasted by the majority of Hollywood. Hollywood is known for being made up predominantly of progressive liberals. You cannot find an actor who is unwilling to use their status, power, fame and money to advance their liberal agenda and causes. Eastwood is one of the few A list celebrities who is conservative. Most others are barely known and dont do tell well after expressing their conservative sentiments. Just look at Mel Gibson and Stacey Dash.\n\nIt is always nice to hear an A lister speak their conservative opinions. Because they are one of the Hollywood elite. Thus, they cannot be scoffed at as easily and dismissed. Certainly not the man, the myth, the legend, Clint Eastwood.'",R
"b'Trump Wont Tell America Where His Products Are Made, So Heres A Handy Guide (IMAGES)'","b'Donald Trump constantly talks about how hell make America great again. Hell bring jobs back, put America first, all that populist, nationalist jazz that put him in the position of being the Republican nominee in the first place. However, theres one thing Trump can do to help Americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the United States of America.\n\nWell, since Trump wont readily make his manufacturing practices available to the American public on his own campaign website, Hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. She calls it A Buyers Guide For Donald Trump. While Donald Trump says that its very hard to have apparel made in this country, or they dont even make the stuff here. Its so hard to get. Hillary proves him wrong right away. Here is a handy map of where Trump can get all of his things made, right here in America, courtesy of HillaryClinton.com:\n\nHillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. For instance, heres all the places Trump can make ties:\n\nInstead, he makes them in China. And that is just one example. Go to Hillarys website for a full list. In other words, Trumps rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-American business practices. If Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, he can start with his own companies.\n\nThanks for the handy guide, Hillary! No doubt Trump will never read it.\n\nFeatured image via Sara D.

b'Howard Dean ROASTS Trump Over Debate Sniffles: Coke User? (TWEETS)',"b'In the first half of the debate, Donald Trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldnt stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)?\n\nHoward Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs.\n\nDean, who is now a contributor for MSNBC, tweeted last night:\n\nNotice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user?  Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016\n\nTrump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system.\n\nAnd considering he hasnt released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state.\n\nOf course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be.\n\nDeans assertion is just that  an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything shes not.\n\nIf this debate showed one thing, its that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is.\n\nFeatured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images'",R
b'See What Happens to Her! [VIDEO]  Eagle Rising',"b'Never has the rights for me, but not for thee idea been more apparent than in the context of gun control. Politicians love to parade around with families of mass shooting victims, particularly if those victims were schoolchildren.\n\nThey talk about how no one needs ten bullets to kill a deer, and they talk about how semi-automatic rifles  especially the black ones  serve no purpose other than to kill a bunch of people in a short amount of time. The only kind of gun they dont seem to have a problem with is a shotgun, as long as its one that holds no more than two rounds at a time.\n\nWhile these same politicians use shooting victims to push their anti-gun ideas, everyone knows that they are surrounded by armed bodyguards. Yes, armed with evil guns. Donald Trump brought this up at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida. He said:\n\nShes very much against the Second Amendment. She wants to destroy your Second Amendment. Guns, guns, guns, right? I think what we should do is  she goes around with armed bodyguards, like you have never seen before. I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm, right? Right? I think they should disarm immediately. What do you think? Yes? Take their guns away! She doesnt want guns. Lets see what happens to her. It would be very dangerous.\n\nEvery gun control politician benefits from the Second Amendment. The high-profile ones surround themselves with security personnel who carry firearms. They know that having armed security around them protects them. But they dont want everyday Americans to be afforded the same right.\n\nFor now, maybe these gun control politicians would say that theyd be okay if Americans had a shotgun at home, as long as that gun was locked up in a safe and completely disassembled, and the ammo was in an entirely different safe on the other side of the house.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",R
b'Louisiana Cop Claims Murdering A 6-Year Old Child Was Self-Defense',"b'A Louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air. This is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. What makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that Deputy Derrick Stafford also shot and killed the suspects six-year old son.\n\nAnd Stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is:\n\nStafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [Christopher] Few which would put the officers in imminent danger.\n\nOfficers went after Christopher Few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. They claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down Few, whose six-year old son, Jeremy, was in the front passenger seat.\n\n18 rounds were fired although Few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and Few and Jeremy were both shot while still in the car. Stafford and his partner, Norris Greenhouse, said that after Few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired.\n\nThats always the story, though. It makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when its obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air.\n\nReports claim that neither Stafford nor Greenhouse knew Jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. Few was critically wounded, and Jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered.\n\nStaffords plea of self-defense is a huge middle finger to Few and the rest of Jeremys grieving family. Arguments will be heard in court next week, where Judge William Bennett will decide whether the indictments stand.\n\nFeatured image via Louisiana State Police Facebook page'",R
b'Debate breaks record as most-watched in U.S. history',"b'Monday night was the most-watched debate in American history.\n\nWell over 80 million people tuned in to see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off, setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the TV channels that carried it live.\n\nMany millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web.\n\nNielsen\'s 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional TV channels at home. People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers.\n\nThis means the actual total audience is even higher.\n\nOn the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks.\n\nNBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC.\n\nABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million.\n\nThe debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo.\n\nTrump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate.\n\nThe debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election.\n\nMore recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers.\n\nDetailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate.\n\nThe vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high\n\nAnticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million.\n\nThere will be two more debates between the candidates in October.\n\nOn Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the ""most tweeted debate ever.""\n\nGiven the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well.\n\nVarious live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people.\n\nOn both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the ""final share of conversation around the candidates on stage"" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton.\n\nOn Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%.\n\nBeing talked about isn\'t necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate.\n\nStill, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage.\n\nCNN\'s reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.'",R

Mark Cuban\'s Response Is Powerful'","b'72k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThe first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.\n\nInstead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.\n\nThere is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was no bigger jagoff in the world.\n\nThe indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets  that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.\n\nClinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clintons hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, That makes me smart. Trumps cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.\n\nAn hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , It sounds like you admitted you havent paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say? Trump replied, No, I didnt say that at all.\n\nTrump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:\n\nI get audited every year my taxes are  it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of  do what the law recommends. But Im not against paying taxes. And Ill give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didnt do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. Im, Im the luckiest guy in the world. Theres nobody whos been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country thats been great to us.

Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.\n\nTrump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trumps world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!'",R
b'Worst. President. Ever.',"b'As my 25th wedding anniversary approached, I tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife. I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were largeup until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.\n\nOh, the Panic of 1857, the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. It was really bad. The president didnt seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNow that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility thatwhoever the winner ishe or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.\n\nBut Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly wont rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was. Ive made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, lets say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaquesstopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldnt be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.\n\nBuchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.\n\nStart with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of Americas great financial downturns.\n\nFor a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent.\n\nThen the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroadBuchanan wanted to stimulate foreign tradebut made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.\n\nThree days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled.\n\nScott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good.\n\nBuchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.\n\nIgnoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.\n\nLegend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate thatand that he would be all for whatever the court decided.\n\nTwo days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.\n\nHistorically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in the courts history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the countrywith not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it.\n\nAs appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.\n\nThousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he ownedhis stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless.\n\nEvery bank in New York City effectively closednone would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co.\n\nBuchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.\n\nThe residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity.\n\nYet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.\n\nBuchanans response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and deserved the gamblers fate. Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.\n\nIn a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.\n\nThroughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid.\n\nIn other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary William Walkers forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatalexcept to one pigbattle. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be.\n\nAs the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plain didnt like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election.\n\nThe Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between Lincolns election and his inauguration in March, thus under Buchanans watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.\n\nAs the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinet membershe had a lot of Southern alliesand refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter.\n\nEnter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the Worst. President. Ever, there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb.\n\nToday, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of 08 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right.

"b""North Korea at UN: US faces 'tremendous consequences'""","b'(CNN) North Korea went on the offensive Friday, blasting the US for ""aggression"" in Asia, blaming Washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the US with ""tremendous consequences beyond imagination.""\n\nThe Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea ""had no other choice but to go nuclear,"" Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly, to defend itself ""from the constant nuclear threats from the United States.""\n\nRi\'s comments came as the US and Asian nations gathered in New York Friday with a fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region: North Korea\'s announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet.\n\nThe test Tuesday was followed by a US show of force, as the Pentagon on Wednesday flew two B-1B bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, setting the the stage for US-South Korea joint military exercises in October that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike.\n\nThe heightened tensions, North Korea\'s steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the Pentagon on notice.\n\n""North Korea\'s unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland,"" Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday in Maryland. ""It\'s consumed an awful lot of time -- I think it\'s fair to say -- of senior leadership\'s time over the past few weeks.""\n\nThe North Korean minister offered a through-the-looking glass version of the same events. ""Only a couple of days ago, the United States has again threatened the DPRK by flying the strategic bombers \'B-1B\' over the military demarcation line on the Korean peninsula and landing in South Korea,"" Ri said. ""We will never remain onlookers at it and the United States will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination.""\n\nMeanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry met Friday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-member bloc dedicated to economic, political and security cooperation.\n\n""The United States will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies,"" Kerry told the ASEAN meeting.\n\nHe called on allies to ""vigorously"" enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged ASEAN members to ""ensure that the DPRK pays a price for its dangerous actions.""\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a blunt call for international action at the UN Wednesday. ""Right before our eyes, North Korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt,"" Abe said. ""There is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now.""\n\nThe perceived threat is changing regional dynamics, bringing old rivals Japan and South Korea closer together. It\'s putting China on the spot as Washington pushes Beijing to do more to rein its ally in, even as tensions over the South China Sea complicate cooperation. And it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions, the likes of which were used to force Iran to the negotiating table.\n\nThat\'s still unlikely to stop North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea, experts said. Indeed, US officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early October.\n\n""From North Korea\'s perspective, it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there\'s a substantial shift in dialogue with the US,"" said Alison Evans, a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm IHS.\n\n""For North Korea, it\'s the recognition that\'s the important thing. It needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized,"" Evans said, adding that, ""The leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival.""\n\nUS officials say the Pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test. Meanwhile, the Union of Concerned Scientists said there is some speculation that Pyongyang may try another satellite launch around October 10, the anniversary of the founding of its Worker\'s Party of Korea.\n\nNorth Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January. In the ensuing months, it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests, including land- and submarine-based launches.\n\nIn May, North Korea\'s 32-year-old leader Kim Jong-un made the country\'s ambitions official, announcing that Pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy.\n\nJUST WATCHED US B-1 bombers fly over South Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US B-1 bombers fly over South Korea 02:52\n\nPyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on September 9, the anniversary of the DPRK\'s founding in 1948.\n\nAnd Tuesday\'s rocket launch was ""substantially larger and more powerful than anything North Korea has tested before,"" according to 38 North, a program devoted to analyzing North Korea at Johns Hopkins University\'s School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nAll this testing is unlikely to win it the US recognition it craves, though.\n\nAfter the more recent nuclear test, President Barack Obama made clear that ""the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state.""\n\nObama said that the US would work with Asian allies, the UN Security Council and international partners to implement existing measures and ""take additional significant steps, including new sanctions to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.""\n\nHowever, the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that Obama administration will soon no longer calling the American shots on the issue.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump has held out the possibility of meeting with Kim in a dramatic break with US political conventions. He earned criticism for the remark, as well as for suggesting that South Korea and Japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons.\n\n""At some point we have to say, you know what, we\'re better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea,"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee in March. ""We\'re better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself.""\n\nThe statements have rattled Tokyo and Seoul, and while Trump has said that China must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally, his promise to play tough with Beijing on trade could also roil that effort.\n\nThe Republican candidate\'s tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding American policy in the region and is likely to be something that US officials are asked to address in their consultations Friday.\n\nPhotos: South Korea, U.S. hold \'largest ever\' drills South Korean and U.S. troops staged an amphibious assault Saturday, March 12 as U.S. and South Korean military units embarked on eight weeks of annual joint military exercises.

On North Korea, specifically, she has emphasized ratcheting up US sanctions.\n\nInternational sanctions levied in March after the January nuclear test were the first on North Korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite. They ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country, among other steps.\n\nThe international community could squeeze North Korea further by targeting the export of its resources, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, echoing the way UN sanctions targeted Iran by banning the export of its oil.\n\n""That is a big step,"" Klingner said, ""it will impact the people of North Korea.""\n\nJUST WATCHED General: US held \'nuclear hostage\' by North Korea Replay More Videos ...

The author works for David Axelrod.\n\nKiev (CNN) He was one of the most effective legislators in Washington, an icon of Democratic politics. Now Barney Frank says the left has been outmaneuvered by the tea party and the populist right.\n\n""To my great regret, the tea party movement has had much more impact on American politics than Occupy Wall Street,"" Frank, former congressman from Massachusetts, said to David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.\n\n""Because the tea party people correctly understood that, for them, what they needed to do was to get control of the political machinery, to register people to vote, to vote in primaries, and influence public policy,"" Frank continued. ""Occupy Wall Street decided that they would bring about great change by smoking pot and having drum circles, and it turns out voting in primaries is a better way to do it.""\n\nThe key to bringing about political change, Frank believes, is not allowing one\'s ideals to overwhelm the sense of moral duty inherent in public service.\n\n""I do believe that, clearly, idealism comes first.

b'Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed Watered-Down AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa  Eagle Rising',"b'Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe congressional report, titled,The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story, was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.\n\nThe congressional report focused on Clintons decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.\n\nIt also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.\n\nRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.\n\nThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nations largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company, said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\nWhen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDAs approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe, said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, alleged due to the companys diluted drugs, it subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality, according to the report.\n\nThe question becomes, how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise, asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obamas first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundations vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the watered-down drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered more than $1.8 million packages.\n\nSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections, Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the companys anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\nThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize, he said.\n\nRanbaxys first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public warning letter to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the companys quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, show much lower potencies in these batches.\n\nAlthough Ranbaxys generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the companys HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said hes now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on access to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. I have tried to reach out to them, he told TheDCNF. But I havent had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was deeply suspect.\n\nIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called CHAI was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation, Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, relaxed intellectual property policy standards, promising the U.S. government would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any Sub-Saharan country relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies, the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAIs endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS relief  a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clintons endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become good acquisition targets, according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years, the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the false hopes offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\nYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me its disturbing and very sad, she said.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com'",R
b'Hillary Clinton prepares for unpredictable Trump at presidential debate',"b'New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week -- hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election, but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all: Preparing for her first face-to-face confrontation with Donald Trump.\n\nWhile she is set to make a quick trip to Florida on Wednesday, after dipping into Pennsylvania on Monday, Clinton will devote the lion\'s share of her time huddling with her debate team, gaming out how she will confront Trump next Monday night at Hofstra University.\n\nThe lead Clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate. The terrorism investigation in New York and New Jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with Trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues.\n\nClinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with Trump. She is preparing for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to Bill Clinton\'s infidelity to her health.\n\nTrump showed he was willing to go there Tuesday when he tweeted, ""Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest.

""I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I have been at this, I understand it is a contact sport.""\n\nTo knock Trump off his game, people advising Clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest.\n\nClinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump\'s Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival Ted Cruz, and studied his style.\n\nBut Democrats worry the first debate will give Trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. This, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on Clinton.\n\nClinton told supporters at an August fundraiser that a friend told her: ""There will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. So don\'t assume they have followed anything.""\n\n""There will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night,"" Clinton said.\n\nA team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including Ron Klain, who advised Obama, and Karen Dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. She is not setting up a formal ""debate camp,"" aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in Chappaqua, New York, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on Monday.\n\nClinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about Trump\'s policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from Tony Schwartz, who was the co-author for ""Art of the Deal,"" the best-seller about Trump.\n\nExpectations game\n\nClinton aides worry that they can\'t lower expectations enough ahead of the event.\n\n""For all his lack of substance, Trump\'s showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton\'s national press secretary, tweeted in August.\n\nWith her Senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with Barack Obama in 2008 and nine meetings with Bernie Sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times.\n\nTrump will not be the first unconventional opponent Clinton has faced in a debate. Clinton all-but ended her 2000 Senate race against Rick Lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the Republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. Lazio\'s bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and Clinton handily beat him by 12 points in November.\n\nJUST WATCHED Debate expectations game is serious business Replay More Videos ...

But I\'m a progressive who likes to get things done,"" Clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning.\n\nClinton\'s performances have not been without missteps, however. The former senator from New York cited the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to Wall Street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attacking her on the issue.\n\nWhich Trump will show up?\n\nIn the last few weeks, as Clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message, the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks.\n\nClinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about Clinton\'s debate process, preferring not to telegraph to the Trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate.\n\nWhen asked about the debates, Clinton has tried to laud Trump\'s debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at Hofstra.\n\n""I do not know which Donald Trump will show up,"" Clinton said at an August fundraiser in New York. ""Maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn\'t done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points.""'",R
b'McConnell plays hardball in spending fight',"b'Sen. Mitch McConnell said a filed spending measure is the ""result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle."" | Getty McConnell plays hardball in spending fight\n\nMitch McConnell is playing hardball  forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month.\n\nWith spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats  yet still isnt enough to get the minority party on board.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June.\n\nThe new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday  which funds the government until Dec. 9  also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.\n\nThere have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So thats what Ive just offered, McConnell said. Its the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.\n\nBut Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesnt include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan.\n\nTo put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don\'t get it,"" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. ""I havent counted votes but our caucus isnt going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan.""\n\nIt also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the banks full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded.\n\nThe president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasnt done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank.\n\nYet McConnell\'s proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation\'s epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika ""with no political riders.""\n\n""While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,"" Nelson said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon.\n\nWere in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time, Reid told reporters. Ive talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi], shes not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this. Its really unfair to the American people.\n\nDuring her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, in my view, is not even worthy of a counter.

"b'Donald Trump, Germanys disfavored son  POLITICO'","b'KALLSTADT, Germany  Few places in Germany are as representative of the countrys heartland as Kallstadt, the village in which U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps grandfather was born  and from which he was later deported.\n\nThe hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-halfs drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pigs stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.\n\nTrump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.\n\nIn fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.\n\nSince a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. With his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him, Steiniger tells POLITICO.\n\nTrumps rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. He stands for everything thats bad, says Sarah Bhler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the towns main square. Bhler is a former local wine princess, the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.\n\nThis year, a new dish appeared in the towns annual festival: Saumagen-Dner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. Everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are, says Bhler. Pink, purple, doesnt matter.\n\nTanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. They dont get that we really dont give a damn about Trump, says Huber. Hes never been here, and he apparently doesnt care about us, either.\n\n* * *\n\nDonalds grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintners family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including Trump, Dromb and Trumpff, according to local historians, or even Drumpf, according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on Trump.\n\nGermany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.\n\nFriedrichs father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.\n\nHe entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. Both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service, said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.\n\nAccording to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship as his own request four years after arriving in the U.S.\n\nBut Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.\n\nBut while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. My grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you, Donald Trumps American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.\n\nFriedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended to return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein, he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blairs family history.\n\nBack in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was to be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.\n\nFriedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife  pregnant once more  had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donalds father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.\n\n[The authorities] said, You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave, says Walter. So they left and they went back to America, and thats why Donald and I are here.\n\nFriedrich  now named Frederick  died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.\n\n* * *\n\nIn February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on Kings of Kallstadt, a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.\n\nFor months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trumps cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.\n\nOn the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Towers top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.\n\nHer plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trumps staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. His assistant just couldnt be bothered, she says.\n\nHello, John, Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousins hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.\n\nTrump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New Yorks Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. Afterwards, I just kept on thinking, What on earth did I do? she says.\n\nThe cake looks really good, Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.\n\nUntil 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. They grow them well in Kallstadt, he told her during their meeting. They grow them very well. Believe me. Its good stock.\n\nWow, its beautiful, Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. Thats fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. Its great.\n\nWhen their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trumps son, Eric Trump.\n\nHave you ever heard the word Kallstadt? Wendel asked him.\n\nKallstadt? Trump Junior replied, No, what is it?'",R
b'Anti-Trump Super PAC Launches Pre-Debate Video Featuring Hofstra Students',"b'An anti-Donald Trump super PAC is going on the offensive ahead of the first presidential debate this Monday at Hofstra University in New York.\n\nThe group, the Not Who We Are campaign, is using students at the very university where the debate will be held to make a point. A new web ad produced by the group features students unfriendly to Trump\'s message.\n\nI dont think you can have a racist bigot as president, one student says in the 60-second spot that was filmed on campus.\n\nAnother chimes in, He makes me terrified.\n\nAnd a third simply says, I dont want him on campus.\n\nThe Not Who We Are campaign plans to run the ad on Twitter and Facebook ahead of and during Mondays debate.\n\nSince the Donald himself is coming to campus, these Hofstra students are standing up and sending a message that bigotry and hatred are not who we as Americans and not who they are as part of the Hofstra community, Not Who We Ares campaign manager Josh Hendler said in a statement.\n\nHendlers group bills itself as a venue for community members and leaders across the country to organize their friends, neighbors and coworkers to take a stand against Trump by writing open letters.\n\nWell help you craft the language and organize co-workers to take a stand against bigotry and hate, the groups website says.\n\nThe site features letters from companies, universities and groups ranging from members of the clergy to scientists to golfers.\n\nOne recent letter, written by Hofstra student Rob Bielunas, reads in part: ""As a community, Hofstra has worked to root out racism, sexism, and xenophobia, the very ideas Mr. Trump has used to get where he is today. His hateful rhetoric and complete disrespect for his fellow citizens are why we, as members of the Hofstra community, stand up against Donald J Trumps run for president.""'",R
"b""America's relationships are on the line  no matter who wins""","b""NEW YORK  All politics is geopolitical in this year's presidential race -- and top Democrats and Republicans fear that will reshape Americas relationships around the world no matter who wins.\n\nThis week, the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in New York as the United Nations General Assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Monday, Hillary Clinton will meet with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenkoa clear dig at the developing partnership between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Shell also sit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her campaign announced Sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of China and North Korea while reminding Americans of Donald Trumps suggestion that America should pull its support from Japan and South Korea.\n\nClinton and Trump both have scheduled meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisian American ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. The Democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that shes up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. Trumps came second and was an attempt by Sisi to ensure even dealings, according to Egypts state news agency. Nonetheless it might offer the Republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on Middle East issues that goes beyond simply banning Muslim immigrants from America.\n\nKeeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for Mitt Romney four years ago and Obamas summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in Berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking Europeans and support the upstart young senator.\n\nBut none of this compares to the degree to which this years race is defined by global affairs  the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges Trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of American foreign policy.\n\nClinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that Trump and the number of votes he gets in November isnt a sign that they need to be worried about America turning away from them.\n\nShes very concerned, said a Clinton aide. Theres no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what hes said, it has an effect on foreign policy.\n\nCertainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the waters edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over Americas borders.\n\nIt will have lasting impact, said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee\n\nIt has been changed, agreed Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a Trump supporter. It gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.\n\nThere has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including Trumps decision to accept an invitation from Mexicos president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare Americas sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. And thats hardly all.\n\nThere was the alleged Russian-led hacking of Democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through WikiLeaks, Trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of Crimea from the GOP party platform, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying hes personally rooting for Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden saying Trump doesnt understand NATO on a trip to Latvia last month, President Barack Obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election.\n\nAnd just Friday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, speaking in Chicago, accused Trump of playing into the hands of ISIL.\n\nOfficials openly wonder what Clintons approach as president would be now to Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto, or how quickly and forcefully NATO would restructure if Trump wins. What if China or Russia or North Korea moves to test the new president right after Inauguration Day? What if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts?\n\nWhile many in Washingtons diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how Clinton, as opposed to Trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do.\n\nHer meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on Trump, the aide acknowledged, but theyre also about thinking through what being on the job on Jan. 20 might entail.\n\nTake Poroshenko, who is rebuking Putin just by being in office: Its impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way Trumps been talking over the course of the campaign, Secretary Clinton thinks its important from a policy standpoint, the aide said.\n\nIf Trump wins, hell have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that U.S. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order.\n\nThey will certainly want to see where were coming from, King said. He will have to clarify and make it clear where hes coming from.\n\nIf Clinton wins, shell have a clean-up that Cardin and others compare to the repair mission Obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on George W. Bush.\n\nCardin, whos firmly behind Clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in Harare earlier in the year, watching Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to Trumps success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter.\n\nCan you imagine if Trump were president and were trying to get a coalition against ISIL and we need to get the support of moderate Sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? Can you imagine what Donald Trumps comments about Muslims coming to America would have on a leader of a moderate Muslim state? Cardin said. Its that type of problems that have now been caused.\n\nThis has all made for tricky travels for Obama, as hes spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. Being abroad doesnt stop people from asking for his take on Trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. Obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far.\n\nIt's not a mystery to people overseas that Democrats and Republicans in the United States have their differences, said a senior administration official. So that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.\n\nFrom the beginning of his presidency, Obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the Middle East to Arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on Putin and brought the Iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening Cuba.\n\nHell make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday morning.\n\nBut the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. Trump didnt run his Mexico trip by the White House. Clinton didnt run her meetings this week by the White House either.\n\nWere having a serious debate, said Ivo Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and Obamas first U.S. permanent representative to NATO. Were going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.\n\nAuthors:""",R
b'Trump team talking to veteran GOP ad man Elsass',"b'Talks of hiring Rex Elsass come as Donald Trump is getting walloped on the airwaves. | Getty Trump team talking to veteran GOP ad man Elsass\n\nDonald Trumps campaign, hoping to counter Hillary Clintons air assault, is in talks with veteran GOP ad maker Rex Elsass, according to three sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nElsass, according to one of the sources, met with Trump officials in New York City last week.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nElsass has deep connections to the Trump campaign. He previously served as a top strategist to vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, and in 2012 he worked with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, who came under widespread criticism after making controversial remarks about rape. Elsass is a partner at Strategy Group for Media, a firm that has also counted Jim Murphy, Trumps national political director, as an employee.\n\nTrumps advertising campaign has been led by Jamestown, a prominent political consulting firm with an anti-establishment edge. Two Jamestown employees, Jason Miller and Larry Weitzner, have taken senior roles in the campaign. Also helping to lead the Trump ad effort is Rick Reed, a veteran GOP strategist who assisted the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry in 2004.\n\nDiscussions about bringing aboard Elsass come as Trump is getting walloped on the airwaves. On Sept. 12, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, detailed in an email to Trump campaign officials how Clinton was outspending the Republican nominee on TV by an astonishing seven-to-one margin. With polling in many battlegrounds suggesting the race is tight, many Republican strategists are concerned that Trumps lack of commercial spending could pose problems as the contest enters its final seven weeks.\n\nThe Ohio-based GOP operative has a long history in Republican politics, having worked for a number of presidential candidates over the years. During this years primary season, Elsass advised Rand Paul and, following Pauls departure from the race, John Kasich. In 2012, he worked for Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich.\n\nNeither Elsass nor a Trump spokesperson responded to requests for comment.\n\nAuthors:'",R
"b""Glenn Beck shares buyer's remorse on Cruz endorsement""","b'Glenn Beck shares buyer\'s remorse on Cruz endorsement\n\nGlenn Beck, a former Ted Cruz surrogate, suggested Monday that hed have been better off backing Marco Rubio in the Republican presidential primary and laced into the Texas senator for throwing his support behind Donald Trump late last week.\n\nFor the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, and its my fault, Beck said on his radio show.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIts my fault, Beck continued. I should have said: You know who can win? You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio, and I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, and theres about 80 percent that I do agree with him on, and hes kind of a politician, but hes a different kind of politician. Hes a young politician. Hes a Hispanic, He can win. Lets go for it.""\n\nInstead, Beck sought a truly honorable man in Cruz  and that will always let you down, he said. But while lamenting the fact that Cruz chose to be a politician Friday, Beck said that he believes the Texas firebrand is still a good man.\n\nIm not gonna condemn him. He is still, I believe, a good man, Beck said. He is just a politician first. Ive never put him into the category of a politician, and thats my fault. He is a politician.\n\nFor his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November.\n\nAfter Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain).\n\nSo a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross  its still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States, I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because its a binary choice? Beck asked.\n\nYou are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle, Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America.\n\nBeck, however, wasnt satisfied. This is information that you had in Cleveland  and hang on just a second before you respond  you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar, Beck said. So you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: Oh, my gosh, hes now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly theres a reason to believe him.\n\nDespite his significant disagreements with Trump, Cruz said, its a binary choice.\n\nIm asking for new information. Im asking you for new information, Beck said. You knew all the things that youre saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now? Whats new?\n\nCruz pointed to the Trump campaigns release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board.\n\nWe discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes, Cruz said.\n\nAfter Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. Now, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights, Cruz said. I hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising I will nominate from these 21, I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, thats a clear choice.\n\nCruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding that hes always been Never Hillary but not ever Never Trump. He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter.\n\nMy speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches, Cruz said. Both of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.\n\nAfter Cruzs appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. He could have come on and said, Look, guys, heres the thing, my supporters are yelling at me, and I know that, because so are mine, he said. My donors, who are all in with the GOP, theyre all saying Ill never fund  I wont fund you for the Senate. I wont fund you for the run in 2020. And I have to make a decision. So the question is do I completely shut myself out of this game or do I play the game as much as I possibly can?\n\nAuthors:'",R

b'Trump Campaign Chair Says Racism Didnt Exist Before Obama  Promptly Resigns',"b'President Obama is right  it appears the people running the Trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes.\n\nAfter Donald Trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming its never been worse for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly.\n\nWrong.\n\nAs usual, no one in the Trump campaign learns their lesson. And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state.\n\nTrumps campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people werent successful in the last 50 years, its their own fault. She also said there wasnt any racism until Obama got elected and skirted problems under the table:\n\nIf youre black and you havent been successful in the last 50 years, its your own fault. Youve had every opportunity, it was given to you. Youve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didnt have. You had all the advantages and didnt take advantage of it. Its not our fault, certainly.\n\nMiller then doubled down, calling the Black Lives Matter movement a stupid waste of time and said low voter turnout in the African American community as due to the way theyre raised.\n\nWhat does the way theyre raised, supposed to mean? Maybe Miller should take a look at the fact that the Trump kids didnt vote (and couldnt even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids.\n\nMiller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. Of course Trumps Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik stressed that Millers comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple volunteer to steer away any influence she once held.\n\nOnce again, the Trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. Oh, and it once again shows that its being run by a bunch of entitled white racists.\n\nFeatured image a screen-grab'",R
b'28-year-old man sought in Manhattan blast',"b'Ahmad Khan Rahami is pictured in an undated photo provided by the FBI. | AP Photo 28-year-old man sought in Manhattan blast\n\nNEW YORK  Police released a photo of a 28-year-old immigrant wanted for questioning Monday in bombings that rocked a Manhattan neighborhood and a New Jersey shore town, and New York\'s governor and mayor said the blasts are looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection.\n\nAhmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan with an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey, should be considered armed and dangerous, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in one of a series of TV appearances just minutes after the photo was released.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn addition to the blast in Manhattan\'s Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town before a charity 5K race and an unexploded pressure cooker device was found blocks away from the explosion site in Chelsea. On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered at an Elizabeth train station.\n\nNew Jersey State Police said Monday, citing the FBI, that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. No one was injured in the Jersey blast.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information they learned there were ""certain commonalities among the bombs,"" leading authorities to believe ""that there was a common group behind the bombs.""\n\n""We want to get this guy in for questioning,"" de Blasio said on CNN. ""We need the facts to be able to piece all this together. ... I think we\'re going to know a lot more in the course of the day. Things are moving very quickly.""\n\nEarly Monday, FBI agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth that\'s tied to Rahami. The activity came hours after one of five devices found at the nearby Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot attempted to disarm it. No one was injured.\n\nSaturday night\'s blast in the bustling Chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people, and another unexploded device made out of pressure cooker was found several blocks away. In the immediate aftermath of that bombing, de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appears to be changing.\n\n""The more we learn with each passing hour, is it looks more like terrorism,"" de Blasio said in a later interview on NY1 News.\n\nCuomo, in a separate interview on MSNBC, said: ""Today\'s information suggests it may be foreign related but we\'ll see where it goes. ... My operating premise is anytime, anywhere, seven days a week you could have an incident like this.""\n\nThe White House said President Barack Obama was briefed throughout the night and early Monday on the investigation into bombs found in New York City and New Jersey. Spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama will comment publicly later Monday.\n\nOn Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped ""a vehicle of interest"" in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser.\n\nShe wouldn\'t provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the ongoing investigation.\n\nNo one has been charged, and the investigation is continuing, Langmesser said.\n\nCuomo, touring the site of Saturday\'s blast in Chelsea, said the unexploded pressure cooker device appeared ""similar in design"" to the bomb that exploded in Chelsea.\n\nOn Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. The discovery of Tannerite may be important as authorities probe whether the two New York City devices and the pipe bomb at the Jersey shore are connected.\n\nCellphones were discovered at the site of both bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn\'t authorized to comment on an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe pipe bomb exploded Saturday in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled and no one was injured.\n\nThe bombings in New York City and New Jersey happened the same day that a man stabbed and injured nine people at a Minnesota mall before an off-duty police officer fatally shot him. The St. Cloud police chief said the man reportedly made at least one reference to Allah and asked a victim if he or she was Muslim before attacking.

Standing in a conference room in the Ritz Hotel in central Moscow on Sunday, Smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card.\n\nIt wasnt the only incongruous encounter taking place at the Ritz at what has been dubbed Moscows international conference of separatists, an eclectic Kremlin-funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self-rule for often unlikely territories.\n\nAmidst the heavy glitz of the hotel, Catalonian separatists and dissident Irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east Ukrainian rebels, Azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self-proclaimed ""King of Hawaii,"" who called in via video link.\n\nAnd among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self-determination, were two Americans campaigning for Texan and Californian secession from the United States.\n\nThe conference, now in its second year, is funded largely by the Kremlin and organized by the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia, a group that closely follows government positions. The movement says it is unconnected to the Kremlin, but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by President Vladimir Putin, which provided close to $546,000 for the project, according to public records. The attendees, including the Texan delegate, had been offered free flights and accommodation.\n\nThe conferences organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups, but its agenda overlaps with Kremlin efforts to promote Russia as an alternative guardian for global order, at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged American imperialism.\n\nOur main goal is to create a multi-polar world, the conferences creator, Aleksander V. Ionov, told its participants. Our president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, is probably the main anti-globalist in the world.\n\nIonov himself, a relatively little-known businessman, has repeatedly met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Russia is backing militarily, saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago.\n\nIonovs conference plays into Moscows own long-time policy of backing separatists in its former Soviet neighbors. While jailing and harassing separatist groups at home, Moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention, most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern Ukraine. A sizable presence of pro-Russian rebel supporters was visible on Sunday, while not a single Russian separatist group took part.\n\nAll that and the anti-American flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the Kremlins orbit.\n\nIts kind of awkward I guess, Smith said after one 30-minute denunciation of American inequity.\n\nABC News\n\nSmiths group, the Texas Nationalist Movement, is campaigning for a referendum on whether Texas should exit the United States. Founded over 10 years ago, the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the Texas state GOP to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the Republican convention. Smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the Kremlin.\n\nWere here to have a dialogue. Were not in agreement with all the groups that are here, Smith said. Were here for very specific reasons. We came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of Texas.\n\nIt was a sentiment echoed by Louis J. Marinelli from the YES California Independence Campaign, there to get his message out about his plan to make the Golden State a nation.\n\nWe want to draw attention to our campaign, Marinelli said. Were not signing an alliance with Russia or anything like that.""\n\nThe two secessionists urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with American foreign policy and a sense the U.S. has become dysfunctional. A gentle-mannered IT consultant married to a Russian, Marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019.\n\nThe U.S. government is so dysfunctional it cant be repaired from within anymore, and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs, we could improve the quality of life for Californians, Marinelli said.\n\nBoth men were hoping for a Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential elections, banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from America. The U.K.\'s recent ""Brexit"" vote to leave the European Union had also heartened many attendees.\n\nBut why exactly the Kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in Moscow, few among the foreign attendees could say. Nor did they appear particularly interested.\n\nIm not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference, Smith said.\n\nHowever, the conference -- and its location in one of Moscows expensive hotels, within shouting distance of the Kremlin walls -- slots into a recognizable recent Russian strategy. Russia has been backing far right political parties in the West, in particular, reportedly funding Frances anti-European Union party, the Front National, with a $10 million loan. The practice echoes that of the Soviet Union, which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world, but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets.\n\nIts a school-book case, said Peter Kreko, a Fulbright visiting professor at Indiana University who has studied Russias use of the far right. The simple reason is that Russia is interested in dividing the Western world. The strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there.\n\nKreko said the idea was to back groups hindering European integration and to undermine faith in Western-style liberal democracy.\n\nThe tool-kit is pretty much the same as in the Soviet Union. Any kind of movements that can cause chaos, Kreko said, adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint Russia as a champion of democracy.\n\nFew of the conference attendees were concerned they might become Kremlin pawns, seeing it simply as a way to get their message out.\n\nEverybodys using everybody, Marinelli said. Were using this conference for our own purposes. We want the attention so that we can get the word out, they want ..."" he trailed off before finishing. Everybodys got their own agenda, right? So, thats just the way it is.\n\nFor most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media, attracted by the conferences oddity.\n\nIve talked to seven media [organizations] today. I\'ve got to get my story out, said Diarmuid Mac Dubhglais, international secretary for Republican Sinn Fin, a tiny Irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of British control over Northern Ireland.\n\nIn any case, Mac Dubhglais said, he wouldnt let Vladimir himself impose ideas on him.\n\nIm not going to start passing out propaganda when I go home and start marching Soviet-style,"" he said.\n\nBesides, he said, perhaps the Russian motive was altruistic. Maybe in fairness, they might think the cause is just, he said then paused, before adding: Im hoping thats what they think.""'",R
"b'Donald Trump, Germanys disfavored son  POLITICO'","b'KALLSTADT, Germany  Few places in Germany are as representative of the countrys heartland as Kallstadt, the village in which U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps grandfather was born  and from which he was later deported.\n\nThe hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-halfs drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pigs stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.\n\nTrump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.\n\nIn fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.\n\nSince a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. With his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him, Steiniger tells POLITICO.\n\nTrumps rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. He stands for everything thats bad, says Sarah Bhler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the towns main square. Bhler is a former local wine princess, the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.\n\nThis year, a new dish appeared in the towns annual festival: Saumagen-Dner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. Everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are, says Bhler. Pink, purple, doesnt matter.\n\nTanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. They dont get that we really dont give a damn about Trump, says Huber. Hes never been here, and he apparently doesnt care about us, either.\n\n* * *\n\nDonalds grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintners family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including Trump, Dromb and Trumpff, according to local historians, or even Drumpf, according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on Trump.\n\nGermany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.\n\nFriedrichs father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.\n\nHe entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. Both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service, said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.\n\nAccording to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship as his own request four years after arriving in the U.S.\n\nBut Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.\n\nBut while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. My grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you, Donald Trumps American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.\n\nFriedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended to return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein, he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blairs family history.\n\nBack in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was to be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.\n\nFriedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife  pregnant once more  had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donalds father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.\n\n[The authorities] said, You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave, says Walter. So they left and they went back to America, and thats why Donald and I are here.\n\nFriedrich  now named Frederick  died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.\n\n* * *\n\nIn February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on Kings of Kallstadt, a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.\n\nFor months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trumps cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.\n\nOn the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Towers top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.\n\nHer plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trumps staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. His assistant just couldnt be bothered, she says.\n\nHello, John, Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousins hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.\n\nTrump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New Yorks Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. Afterwards, I just kept on thinking, What on earth did I do? she says.\n\nThe cake looks really good, Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.\n\nUntil 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. They grow them well in Kallstadt, he told her during their meeting. They grow them very well. Believe me. Its good stock.\n\nWow, its beautiful, Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. Thats fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. Its great.\n\nWhen their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trumps son, Eric Trump.\n\nHave you ever heard the word Kallstadt? Wendel asked him.\n\nKallstadt? Trump Junior replied, No, what is it?'",R
"b'Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton Spar Over Taxes in First Presidential Debate'","b""When Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns and allegedly paying zero in federal income taxes, the Republican presidential nominee had just four words to say in response.\n\nThat makes me smart, Trump said from the debate stage at Hofstra University tonight.\n\nHe has said repeatedly he is being audited by the IRS and cannot release his tax statements until the review is concluded. But during the first general-election presidential debate, in Hempstead, New York, the real estate mogul vowed to release his tax returns against my lawyers wishes if Clinton releases emails she deleted from a private server she used while she was secretary of state.\n\nAs soon as she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, as soon as she releases them, Trump said tonight, amid cheers and applause, I will release my tax returns.\n\nThe White House hopefuls also clashed repeatedly over their tax plans during the debate, with Clinton accusing Trump of proposing the most extreme version of trickle-down economics.\n\nThe biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in county than weve ever had, the Democratic presidential nominee said from the stage. I call it trumped-up trickle-down because thats exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\n\nBefore Trump had a chance to defend his tax policy, Clinton took another jab.\n\nDonald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit, she continued. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that.\n\nTrump, who released his tax plan earlier this month, has proposed tax cuts across the board, including income tax reductions for the top 1 percent and eliminating federal estate tax as well as gift taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton has called for tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans and closing corporate loopholes that allow the rich to evade some tariffs.\n\nTrump fired back, blaming politicians like Secretary Clinton for plunging the nation into debt.\n\nWere a debtor nation, he said. We have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we dont have the money because its been squandered on so many of your ideas.\n\nClinton suggested that Trumps alleged failure to pay federal income tax might also be part of the problem. But Trump quickly argued any taxes he would have paid would have gone to waste.\n\nIt would be squandered too, believe me, he said.\n\nABC News' Nicole Phillip, Maggie McNish and Sunny Choo contributed to this report.""",R

"b'Clinton, Trump meet world leaders for very different reasons'","b'New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both met with world leaders in town for the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals.\n\nBoth Clinton and Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks.\n\nClinton, who served for four years as President Barack Obama\'s secretary of state, also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nWhile the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for Trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next Monday.\n\nTrump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader.\n\n""I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I\'ve had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I\'m doing well and, you know, they seem to think it\'s important to maybe meet,"" Trump said Monday on Fox News. ""I don\'t want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over.""\n\nHe later said, ""I\'ve already met with a couple,"" but refused to say which ones.\n\nClinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president.\n\nClinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan\'s Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi.\n\nWhile reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the ""path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties.""\n\nTrump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump\'s top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting.\n\n""Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt\'s war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,"" the Trump campaign said.\n\nThe Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his ""high regard for peace-loving Muslims,"" the campaign added.\n\nThe campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship ""vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East.""\n\nSisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month.\n\nSitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts.""\n\nClinton\'s meetings were announced before Trump\'s, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House.\n\n""If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,"" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. ""While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins.""\n\nThe meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton\'s lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady.\n\nTrump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto earlier this year.\n\nThe meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but Pea Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it.\n\nClinton\'s campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump\'s ""embarrassing international incident.""\n\n""When you see that he can\'t even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,"" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting.\n\nFor her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn\'t need to burnish her foreign policy credentials.\n\nInstead, she\'ll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points.\n\nClinton\'s meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton\'s campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.\n\nClinton\'s adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian ""aggression"" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself.\n\nCurrently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine\'s armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians.\n\nClinton\'s meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President\'s government and the Obama administration.\n\nClinton, according to an aide in the room, ""emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt\'s future progress"" and ""discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS.""\n\nClinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country.\n\nClinton\'s adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nSisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt\'s longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama\'s cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally.\n\n""There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,"" the official said.\n\nTrump\'s positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who ""recognize that this ideology of death"" must be extinguished.\n\nClinton\'s meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea\'s latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton\'s commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path.\n\nClinton, according to an aide, discussed ""the threat from North Korea"" and ""relations with China"" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected.\n\nThere is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang\'s growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.'",R

"b""Meet This Week's White Texan Terrorist Trump Isn't Talking About""","b'21.2k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nWhile the media was busy talking about the NYC bombings and the arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, there was another bomb threat in Houston, Texas that did not receive nearly the same media attention. LA Times reporter Matt Pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start, and took to Twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the NYC bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved.\n\nAccording to a news release from U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson, Houston man Cary Lee Ogborn was arrested last Friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting Houston, Texas. The statement from the U.S. Attorney specified that, Cary Lee Ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building. He was arrested late Friday after picking up a package he believed contained such explosives.\n\nAlthough Ogborns plan to attack Houston was thwarted before it could cause a tragedy, Matt Pearces tweet struck a chord with many people who are disappointed the media is more likely to push a story when it advances a criminal narrative that fits a profitable news-worthy formula usually including Islamic terrorism or black and latino criminality.\n\nDespite the high-profile coverage of several attacks committed by Islamic terrorists, the numbers just do not reflect this narrative. Research from Gallup and the Triangle Center On Homeland and Security found that Law enforcement agencies in the United States consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized Muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face due to the fact that Muslim-American terrorist suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 9/11, [represent] just a small percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the United States each year.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

b'This Was the Trump Hillary Wanted America to SeeBut Did It Work?',"b""If I hadnt seen the last fifteen months of this campaign, Id have no problem in asserting who won this first debate on Monday night. It was Hillary Clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of Donald Trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor.\n\nSo whats my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? It has to do with Trumps not failing badly. He did not show himself to be unfit for the presidency, which was Clintons main accusation against him. In the countless other occasionsfrom his announcement speech onthe ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that Trumps campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. His supportersand every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thoughtdo not hear him the way those of us whove covered campaigns do. The insults, the sneers? That just shows hes the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. And what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on Monday night)? It doesnt matter, because hes got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf hes blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then thats a sign that hes a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again Monday night.\n\nMeasured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is unfit for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional Republicans have argued? Clinton did bring up the 50 GOP national security experts who have rejected him, but Trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him.\n\nAnd what of other standard measure? Atmospherics? She was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle Marco Rubio impersonation. Demeanor? Its hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing.\n\nOn the respective vulnerabilities? He launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then  the issue went away. By contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the birther issue, which he linked to outright racism. And his defensesthat he took advantage of the laws of the nation in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxeswere somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. Its telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\n\nMoreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out racist: charging hed stiffed many of those whod worked for him. (She managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for Trump.)\n\nFinally, at the very end of the debate, moderator Lester Holt confronted Trump with his statement that Clinton did not have the look of a presidenta clear implication that this was a matter of gender. When Trump tried to shift the ground to a question of stamina, a smiling Clinton was ready.\n\nWell, she said, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\n\nThat worked very well. I have little doubt that Clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. But if this campaign so far has proven anything, its that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. And Im very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.""",R

b'McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal',"b'""I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter,"" Sen. Mitch McConnell said. | Getty McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure Monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over Zika funding largely resolved.\n\nThe key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, McConnell said  giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until Dec. 9. For now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the Zika virus while allowing Planned Parenthoods partner clinic in Puerto Rico to access the federal grants  a provision that had been a major point of contention.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSenate Republicans stand ready to move forward, McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday. I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.\n\nMcConnell spent about five minutes huddling with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the Senate to recess as soon as the end of the week.\n\nBut the tentative resolution on Zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. Senate Democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone Zika bill over restrictions that barred Planned Parenthood  particularly Profamilias, the health care providers partner in Puerto Rico  from the federal funds. But in the CR, the Puerto Rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion Zika package, multiple sources said.\n\nLanguage in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landmine thats delayed Zika aid for months.\n\nDespite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. In a brief interview Monday morning, Reid said no when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day.\n\nClose is relative, Reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach.\n\nFor instance, funding for the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, continues to be in the mix. Democrats on both ends of the Capitol have lobbied for Flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a Senate water resources bill.\n\nBut Republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken Louisiana in the short-term spending measure. Both issues remained unresolved as of Monday evening, although senior Senate Democrats suggested they wouldnt accept flood aid without also getting money for Flint. Congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the Zika funding package.\n\nLouisiana is not resolved because [Republicans] want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday evening. They dont want to do Flint.\n\nAnother issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the Obama administrations proposal to hand over the U.S. governments authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1  a push thats being led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of other Republican lawmakers. If no deference is paid to Cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among Republicans  even with some pushback on the provision from Democrats.\n\nThis is the coordination of the domain names. Its not who has control of the Internet, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said Monday. And every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the Export-Import Bank to finance projects greater than $10 million  which it hasnt been able to do because three of the five seats on the banks board are vacant. The Ex-Im issue is similarly toxic among Republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election.\n\nThere are other items that could fill up the Senates legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the November elections. Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plan to force a Senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that the Obama administration announced last month.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. Cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by President Barack Obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThough Obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until Friday to do so.\n\nRepublicans  who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the Senate in the balance  privately believe Democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the Sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:'",R

b'The 8 Biggest Unforced Errors in Debate History',"b""On the night of September 26, as the house lights dim in the Mack Complex at Hofstra University and the TV cameras go live, millions of Americans will be riveted to the scene. Will Donald Trump seem well prepared? Will Hillary Clintons commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? Will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president?\n\nExperience suggests its hard to make a positive breakthroughespecially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. But what is possible is a serious unforced error.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOver the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffea mistake live on TV that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate.\n\nDespite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. What the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: Every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how Americans evaluate their performances. And although debates dont usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters impressionswhich matters on Election Day.\n\nFor both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. Donald Trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of boundswhich could lead to an unforced error by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under Trumps skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. If either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into.\n\n1. 1960: Nixon sweats while debating JFK\n\nFamously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. After eight years as vice president, Richard Nixon was running to inherit the White House from the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower. His challenger was John F. Kennedy, the charismatic young Massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation.\n\nOn September 26, at the candidates first debate, Nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. But he looked terrible. Famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. But that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, Nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. As a result, he looked peaked.\n\nVideo: The Biggest Unforced Errors in Debate History From Richard Nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to George H.W. Bush checking his watch before an audience questionhere are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in U.S. history.\n\nDuring their televised rumble, Nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. His pale color and five o'clock shadow didnt help. All of which undercut his performance against Kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor.\n\n2. 1976: Ford and Carter freeze in a moment of crisis\n\nA more dramatic moment occurred on September 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in Philadelphias Walnut Street Theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter awkwardly stood still on stage. The broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems.\n\nNeither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that Saturday Night Live could imagine. Moderators Robert McNeil and Jim Lehrer kept talking as the candidates stood helplessly like two Hollywood stand-ins, wrote Jules Witcover in the Washington Post.\n\nYears later, Ford admitted that I suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we werent physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this. In the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights.\n\n3. 1980: Carters grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious\n\nIn politics, brevity can be a virtue. During his only debate with Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980, Jimmy Carter didnt get that lesson.\n\nIn front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, Carter was hoping to paint Ronald Reagan as a creature of the far rightsomeone like Barry Goldwater, the GOP nominee whom Lyndon Johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. As Reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable Republican, Carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how Reagan had opposed Medicare in 1964.\n\nWhile Carter looked grim on the attack, Reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: There you go again, he said with a laugh. The line undercut Carters entire argument, making Reagan look like the bigger man.\n\n4. 1984: Mondale lets Reagans one-liner negate a serious weakness\n\nDuring 1984s first debate, Reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. He stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. His opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale, was crisp and sharp. In contrast, Reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. Lou Cannon wrote that Reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser Stu Spencer that he had flopped. The Wall Street Journals headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: New Question in Race: Is Oldest President Now Showing his Age?\n\nFortunately for Reagan, he came back with a vengeance. In a later debate, when Baltimore Sun journalist Henry Trewitt asked Reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, Reagan had a quip for the ages: I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponents youth and inexperience.\n\nThe audience erupted in laughter, including Mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge.\n\n5. 1988: Dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question\n\nPerhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis at the second debate of 1988.\n\nDukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. The night before the debate, at 2 a.m., Shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. And so he began the debate with it: Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\n\nReporters were shocked, but Dukakis seemed unperturbed. In a clinical and dispassionate manner, Dukakis simply said No, I dont Bernard, and I think you know that Ive opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I dont see any evidence that its a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.\n\nIt was as though Dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. Voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. It was a question about Dukakiss values and emotions, his campaign director, Susan Estrich, later recalled. When he answered by talking policy, I knew we lost the election.\n\n6. 1992: Bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question\n\nDuring the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to George H.W. Bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.\n\nRight before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average Americans, Bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. Only 10 more minutes of this crap, Bush would later say he was thinking at the time.\n\nChecking the time wouldve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it didduring a debate in which ordinary Americans posed questions to the presidential candidatesit seemed like Bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. For a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him.\n\n7. 2000: Gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with Bush\n\nEntering the debates in 2000, Vice President Al Gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in George W. Bush. Gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show American voters that Bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president.\n\nDuring the first debate, Gores overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with Bush backfired big time. At several points, microphones caught Gore loudly sighing in response to Bushs answers, which played into Republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. And as Bush criticized the Democrats plans for their fuzzy math, Gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration.\n\nAt the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: Gore walked right up to Bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. Looking up with an annoyed glance, Bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making Gores action look odd as the audience laughed.\n\nDonna Brazile, who ran Gores campaign, believed that Gore won the debates on policy but on mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing  many of us remember the split-screen, and Al Gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at George Bush, and basically he started to sigh.\n\n8. 2004: Bush cannot contain his irritation at Kerry\n\nAfter the first debate of the general election in 2000, President Bush came under criticism when he couldnt contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, Senator John Kerry, made about Bushs record.\n\nThough Bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against Vice President Al Gore, the critics werent so kind to Bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to Kerry speak. The Democratic National Committee didnt wait long to pounce on the president. In their online video, Faces of Frustration, viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing Kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with Bushs angry looks on the right side.\n\n***\n\nAppearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. What the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event.\n\nAnd on September 26, 56 years to the day since Nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with JFK, well see what happens.\n\nJulian E.

b'Obama nominates ambassador to Cuba in long-shot move',"b'Jeffrey DeLaurentis will serve as America\'s ambassador to the communist-led country. | Getty Obama nominates ambassador to Cuba in long-shot move\n\nWhen it comes to picking fights with Republicans over Cuba, Barack Obama has apparently decided he\'s only a lame-duck, second-term president once.\n\nThe president announced Tuesday that he has nominated Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top U.S. diplomat currently serving in Cuba, to serve as America\'s official ambassador to the communist-led country.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe move is sure to draw howls of protest from some hard-core opponents of the Cuban government, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, who have vowed to block any ambassador nomination for Cuba.\n\nStill, Obama\'s decision suggests he\'s willing to take on the risk of a dragged-out fight over a topic  Cuba-U.S. relations  that has increasing bipartisan support.\n\nThe island nation restored diplomatic ties with the U.S. in July 2015 after more than 50 years of hostility, and Obama considers America\'s new relationship with Cuba one of his signature foreign policy achievements.\n\nDeLaurentis is a career member of the U.S. foreign service who has been the chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Havana since it was re-established in 2015 and headed what was an American interests section there before that. He was widely believed to be the frontrunner for the ambassador\'s job should Obama select a nominee.\n\n""The appointment of an ambassador is a common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries,"" Obama said in a statement announcing his decision.\n\nAmong those appaluding Obama\'s decision was Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has long advocated for better U.S.-Cuba relations.\n\n""Americans traveling & doing business in #Cuba will be well-served by the prompt confirmation of Jeff DeLaurentis to serve as US ambassador,"" Flake tweeted.\n\nBut although a growing number of Republicans have shown support for deepening ties to Cuba, it takes only a single senator to severely slow down a nomination process for an ambassador.\n\nAsked by POLITICO earlier this year whether he still held firm to his denouncement of the rapprochement with Cuba and his vow to block an ambassador confirmation, Rubio said yes.\n\n""A U.S. ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government, which is a dictatorial, closed regime, the senator, who is of Cuban descent, said as the one-year anniversary of Cuba-U.S. ties loomed.\n\nRubio\'s office subsequently issued a statement assailing the nomination.\n\n""This nomination,"" Rubio said, ""should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people.""\n\nAuthors:'",R
b'Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump',"b'AP Photo Backtalk Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump The GOP candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be.\n\nWriting as a former legislative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of Hillary Clinton for president, I was disappointed to see in Politico the screed written by my former colleague, Adam Walinsky, excoriating Clintons record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that Donald Trump should therefore be elected president. It is one thing to disagree with Secretary Clinton, which Walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to Donald Trump.\n\nWe should be clear that Walinskys critique is not confined to Clinton. He lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of Clinton but also of President Obama and almost the entire Democratic Party. The analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. President Eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. The 21st century version begins with the Iraq War, which was originated by a Republican President. I am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that Presidents Obama, Clinton and Carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. The question here is whether Donald Trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot.\n\nWalinsky finds in Trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. Any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, Trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with NATO and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the U.S. or to himself, and pledges that Americas pride needs to be vindicated militarily. America First, Trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of Charles Lindbergh to mindbefore excoriating President Obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the Islamic State.\n\nTo compare John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy to Donald Trump iswell, I wont finish the sentence. Yes, Robert Kennedy turned against the Vietnam War, but not because he felt that America should retreat from the world. He opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of American interests. The result, as we know, was the death of Vietnamese and Americans and others who should not have died. JFK and RFK were internationalists. They understood that World War II left the United States with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. They understood that America must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. They understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. They made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively.\n\nWalinsky quotes Robert Kennedys statement that if any member of the ExComm other than John F. Kennedy had been president during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. Ask yourself what a President Trump might have done in that moment. Restraint is not the word that comes to mind.\n\nThis is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of Muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the United States should have seized Iraqs oil resources as spoils to the victor.\n\nYes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. But electing Donald Trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. The answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither American security interests nor egregious human rights violationsa topic in which Donald Trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for Vladimir Putin reflects.\n\nAll the evidence, provided again and again by Donald Trumps own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principlea man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. He is like the weather in New England: If you dont like it, wait a minute. We do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. We do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much.\n\nEven if Walinskys diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to Donald Trump. Of all occasions to break ranks with the Democratic Party, this is the most inappropriate. Of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of John and Robert Kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious I have ever seen.\n\nTo say that I am disappointed by what Walinsky has done is an understatement. America, in this election, faces an existential questionand history will judge us by our answer. Walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.\n\nPeter Edelman is the Carmack Waterhouse professor of law and public policy at Georgetown University Law Center.'",R

It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.\n\nHopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trumps statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trumps entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue.\n\nBut it appears that Trumps attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the birther myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

b'Trumps High-Energy War on American Politics',"b""There is a moment at every Donald Trump rally when Donald Trump marvels at the crazy spectacle hes created. Is there any place in America as fun as a Donald Trump rally? he asks with a mischievous pursed-lip grin. The moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! Thats the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect Americans. When you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and Mexicans and Muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying Merry Christmas.\n\nDonald Trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues, a chain-saw artist named Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers 4 Trump, told me at a recent Pensacola rally.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhen Trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isnt a normal politician. And his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. They feel like Wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. They feel like revival meetings for the Donald J. Trump Church of Cultural Resentment, with ritual denunciations of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack ObamaWe call him President Obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?and other enemies of the congregation. At a time when Americans say theyre tired of politics as usual, Trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual.\n\nHis opponent does not. Clintons events feel exactly like normal political events. She may be the worlds most famous and polarizing woman, but shes running an almost generic Democratic campaign, politics as very usual.\n\nTonight, Hillary Clinton will take on Donald Trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. But their contrasting records and ideas havent been the defining divides of this strange political year. What 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. And no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, youre constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is Trump. He is violating all the rules of the political gamerules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decencyand when 2016 is over, its not clear whether those rules will still apply.\n\nWhatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone whos attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like Love Trumps Hate or Stronger Together. The small venues are selected to target niche groupsmillennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlandoand the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive.\n\nI thought it was very substantial, very specific, Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a Hil Yes! pin to Clintons speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. The purpose wasnt to whip the crowd into a frenzy. Were not looking to choose a president based on emotion.\n\nClinton had better hope not. Theres electricity at Trump rallies that hers cant match. Its no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think youre prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. Its entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (Its 100 degrees in here. And thats considered cool for an auditorium.) He casually drops one outlandish bombshellthe Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the worldthen moves onto another before the last fully explodes.\n\nClinton doesnt do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trumps unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isnt getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic.\n\nNobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clintons campaign, like his accusations that its policy-free, when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But theres something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speecheshe claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that longwith a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in.\n\nBom. Bom. Bom. See ya! Trump smirked. See ya! Im going home.\n\nMany Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trumps say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions hes shredding every day.\n\n***\n\nBefore attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his Im-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruzs citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet.\n\nTrump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the bad, dishonest, very bad people in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word sir to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as a big fat bubble, and predicted a collapse that would be beautiful to watch. He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: I didnt put him there! Im not paying him! He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself more militaristic than anyone in this room, complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a yearactually the presidents salaryand announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled.\n\nWhoever the hell brought this mic systemdont pay the son of a bitch! he seethed. Dont pay em. Dont pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldnt pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because theyll pay, they dont care. So were not going to pay. I guarantee, Im not paying for this mic.\n\nSo I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacolas 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: Tyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack! The crowd started chanting LOCK HER UP! before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, andwell, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected.\n\nHes freeing up our speech, said one Trump supporter.\n\n\n\nWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty Maybe well be able to say Merry Christmas again.\n\nTrump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clichs and Republican talking points about encrusted insiders and turning the page. He said the kind of things regular politicians say: The history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. And: Once again, well have a government of, by, and for the people. He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowdduring one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: What about white people?but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wallbut really, who still thinks about them?\n\nAfterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadnt noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing all the problems in the world, including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that personally, I think shes an unstable person, and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone right smack in the middle of the heartand she wouldnt be prosecuted, OK? He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putinand then he had cozied up again: Hes been nice to me, and if hes nice to me, thats fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldnt be so bad, would it? And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that the country is collapsing.\n\nThose all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. Were normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military incredibly weak, defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black communitywhich endured slavery and Jim Crowwas in the worst shape theyve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever! Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline Restraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline. Predictably, Trump mocked Clintons health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didnt have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldnt make it through one.\n\nThat sort of behavior just hasnt been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But its that defiant you-cant-tell-me-what-Im-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. Hes not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about peoples feelings, always watching our Ps and Qs, so its cool to see him speak his mind, said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathinghe doesnt even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didnt stumble around like she did on the videoTrump is a businessman with nothing to fear: Hell call a spade a spade, and if you dont like it you can shove it. Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs.\n\nHes freeing up our speech, said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. We can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying were offensive. Maybe well be able to say Merry Christmas again.\n\nIts fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed offat a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didnt want hate in their state: Lazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job! He explained to me that America was under siege, with thousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina, and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered deplorable.\n\nThe Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalitionand they seemed less anxious than pissed off.\n\nOne of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: We want our state rights back!\n\nWere sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats, says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Dont Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. Trump is saying what were all thinking: Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights dont end where your feelings begin!\n\nTrump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as the oldest play in the Democratic playbook. And hes begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that its so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: Ill say it openly, and some people dont like it, I dont really care: What do you have to lose? His long riffs about how hell fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks cant walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths dont get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percentthe real rate is about one third of thathes fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenyaand many I spoke to believe hes also a Muslim who supports ISIS.\n\nOne notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. A lot of us who like him dont like the stuff he says about race, Cohen said. Obviously, some do.\n\nThis really isnt normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normala First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreamsshe presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak.\n\nI remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it.\n\nIn 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. Shes tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasnt been about standard anything.\n\n***\n\nNearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clintons Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an Inclusive Economy, to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supportersa much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverseabout her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clintons concern about a worthy issue.\n\nIt did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show.\n\nI thought it was a nice speech, Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. Not very exciting, but I believe shell do what she says.\n\nThe speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimers disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators.\n\nThe rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: Across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. Theyre holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us. Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal, Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value.\n\nClinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Childrens Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Departments first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people shes knownincluding the unbelievably good-looking actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that family values should mean that every family has valueand her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the sub-minimum wage that is currently paid to some disabled workers.\n\nThe audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a really slow, vicious death to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesnt feel bad if theyre working harder than ever because he is too, Clintons scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clintons remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didnt even mention Trumps reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics.\n\nGeannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter.\n\n\n\nBelieve me, Ive seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children, she said. Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\n\nIn fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Downs Syndrome and lead a productive life. What Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home, Kilsheimer said. I know a lot of people dont trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but shes got heart.\n\nGeannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clintons message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. Believe me, Ive seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children, she said. Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\n\nPolitical scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but theyre less likely to turn out to vote if they arent fired up. In any case, even at her own events, its a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trumps crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. My daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. Weve got plenty to lose, said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. Theres never been a candidate who thought so little of us.\n\nMany Hispanics are similarly energized by Trumps calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. He thinks were all Mexicans, and were all bad, Gutierrez said. People arent super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, theyll come out to stop Trump.\n\nClintons excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. Shes OK, I guess, said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. My main worry is Trumps fingers on the nuclear code. But Id say she knows what shes doing. In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said theyre struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think shes a typical lying politician, so theyre voting for Trumpand her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so theyre staying home.\n\nShes been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her, he said. Shes great on the issues, but its hard to get people to focus on that.\n\nClinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husbands administration and recovery during Obamas with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. When Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it, said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. Man, Hillary should talk about that.\n\nBut Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasnt focused on his policies, because theyre so insubstantial and flexible, because hes trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. Its a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trumps plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump.\n\nSo Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. Theyve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it.\n\n***\n\nTonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trumps distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trumps political brand is all about breaking the rules.\n\nWhat is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the presidents health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just cant say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonights debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it wont be normal, but it wont be the first time, either.\n\nAnd yes, even though shes unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quonot just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. Shes playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldnt feel so stilted if her opponent hadnt started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that theyll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event.\n\nBut the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning arent the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, theyre part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline valuesshowing basic respect to political opponents and people who arent like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequencesthat have constrained politicians in a good way. Its not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when theyre gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. And Trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.""",R
"b""Trump Campaign Chair Says Racism Didn't Exist Before Obama In Viral Rant""","b'24.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trumps Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in America didnt exist until President Obama. I dont think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this  Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, thats a big change, and I think thats the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.\n\nThis perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance  blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy.\n\nSupporting her candidates constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that if youre black and you havent been successful in the last 50 years, its your own fault. Youve had every opportunity, it was given to you. Youve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didnt have. You had all the advantages and didnt take advantage of it. Its not our fault, certainly.\n\nTo put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that the Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans were raised.\n\nIn one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface.\n\nShe is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied I dont care, its the truth.\n\nThe Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nUPDATE: Kathy Miller has resigned her from her position with the Trump campaign and has issued an apology. It should be noted the Trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season.\n\nWatch it here  her remarks begin at 4:40:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

Instead, Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who negotiated the truce two weeks ago, went their separate ways as violence in Syria flared anew and the relationship between the two key foreign powers in the conflict appeared to reach a new low.\n\nNo one spoke of being able to quickly resuscitate the cease-fire.

The wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the English Channel. The wall will cost an estimated two million pounds  about $2.5 million  and will be approximately 13 feet high.\n\nThere is a nearby migrant camp called the Jungle that has been attacking vehicles in an attempt to climb aboard lorries and cars in order to enter the United Kingdom.

Buy Now\n\nThe Jungle now has more than 10,000 migrants and it has become a hotspot for violence. Police have called that area of Calais a no-go zone after dark, due to the endemic violence in the area. The migrants have been known to cause car crashes, leave debris on the road, thrown rocks off of bridges and started fires. They have also physically attacked drivers with bats, stabbed them with knives and even threatened people with chainsaws.\n\nIt is these attacks that encouraged Calais port chief executive Jean-Marc Puissesseau to support the wall. This wall is going to prevent migrants from getting onto the road every night, he said. We can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults.\n\nLiberals in the United Kingdom predictably opposed the construction of the wall, comparing it to the policies of Donald Trump.

b'Is West Virginia Holding Americas Weirdest Election?',"b""A billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his fathers inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. But in this case its not Donald Trump. Its Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot.\n\nLike Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginias only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trumps strongest states.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWest Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 4931 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders 51 percent in the states May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win.\n\nThats led to a dynamic in which West Virginias GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. Its very nearly the opposite of whats happening in other states with close races.\n\nAcross the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, its pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole, says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabatos Crystal Ball at the University of Virginias Center for Politics. This is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.\n\nIn this race, Trump isnt a drag on Republicans; hes an asset.\n\nThe reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with war on coal rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. Its hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russias OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price.\n\nCole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but hes no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools.\n\nIn a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket.\n\nIf you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win, says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. If you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are knownthe wall, universal health care, the coal industrybut so much of whats driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.\n\nJustice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. Hes flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he wont vote for Clinton and dismissed Coles claim that he supports Obama as complete dog snot.\n\nAnd while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate isnt focused on the national political circus, the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. Jim is no politician, says Herring. He is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.\n\nAt the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent.\n\nMany doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. Do I think Justice has a lead? Yes, says Gates. Do I think its double digits? No.\n\nSome of that is because Justices industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOPs otherwise effective war on coal messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields.\n\nIf youre going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton, says Dave Mudcat Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said hes voting for Trump, says voters dont trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. She said shes going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners dont want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.\n\nIf youre going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton, says one Democratic strategist.\n\nBut Saunders doesnt have kind words for Justice either: Hes screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.\n\nCole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justices business record over the next several weeks. Jim Justice is a coal operator, but hes not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia, Gates says. His legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.\n\nThat record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice stands out among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down.\n\nThe problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justices mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. Thats an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million.\n\nThe pattern apparently extends to Justices other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court.\n\nJustices mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election.\n\nBoth Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy thats suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, West Virginias 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy.\n\nMines sit idle as a string of industry giants Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energyfiled for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, its unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal.\n\nThe coal industrys struggles havent just hurt West Virginias employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward.\n\nJustice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, hes brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints training camp to the Greenbrier.\n\nIn late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.\n\nJustice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbriers reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment.\n\nWhether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabatos Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governors race from Leans Republican to Toss-up. Were being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton, Kondik says.\n\nTrump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governors race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. Thats why Coles campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal war on coal. Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesnt matter, so long as theyre not voting for Justice.\n\nIn his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: At the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do whats best for Jim Justice.\n\nThat line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether whats in Justice and Trumps best interests is in theirs, too.\n\nMason Adams writes from southwest Virginia.

b'Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats',"b'Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, its clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans.\n\nData analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians.\n\nContrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent.\n\nSo while its not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case.\n\nNate Silvers FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clintons chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. The New York Times election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina.\n\nAgain, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November.\n\nDemocrats shouldnt get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama.\n\nWith 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8.\n\nRachel Maddow broke down the facts on her show:\n\nFeatured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images'",R

The post was signed with her initial, H, indicating that the post was written personally by Clinton.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCell phone video showing the shooting released Friday by NBC News and The New York Times does not conclusively show whether the victim was armed when police officers shot him.\n\nThe video, recorded by Scotts wife Rakeyia Scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible.

In the video, released by the victims family, police officers are heard yelling at Keith Scott to drop the gun while his wife shouts he has no weapon and he has no gun.\n\nAttorneys for the family have said that Keith Scott was not holding a gun when he was shot, although police have said they recovered a firearm and photos from the scene appear to show one lying next to the victims body.\n\nThe video offers a different perspective from the dashboard camera and body camera footage that also captured the shooting but has not yet been released.

"b""How Congress Can Override President Obama's Veto of the 9/11 Bill""","b'On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to override President Obama\'s veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo how exactly does a veto override work?\n\nThe rules are described in Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution. When the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. Then, the members of that chamber ""shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.""\n\nIn other words, the president sends vetoed Senate bills back to the Senate to reconsider first and vetoed House bills back to the House to reconsider first. In this case, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, began in the Senate, so the Senate votes first.\n\nBoth the House and the Senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president\'s veto. Both chambers also require the ""yeas and nays"" to be counted. In the House, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the Senate they take a roll call vote, in which each senators name is called by the clerk.\n\nThough the Senate received President Obamas veto message on Friday, theyre not voting on it until Wednesday. This is common, according to the Congressional Research Service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the Senate floor.\n\nThen, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, ""Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding?""\n\nWhile some Senate Democrats and Republicans have concerns that the JASTA bill would open the United States up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key Middle East ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass.\n\nAssuming it clears the Senate, the JASTA veto override will then head to the House, where the same voting process will ensue.\n\nIf the veto override is successful in the House and the Senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president\'s objection.'",R
b'Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover',"b'Sen. Chuck Schumers money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover\n\nChuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And now hes starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader.\n\nThe New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats campaign arm on Tuesday. Hes also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEarlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls.\n\nRepublicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way.\n\nThe Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money, said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. Were just trying to allocate our resources so theyre meaningful to us and our candidates.\n\nSchumers money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.\n\nSchumers donation is both a vote of confidence in his partys candidates and a reflection of Democrats future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade.\n\nSchumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates. Hes planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidates thats projected to bring in upwards of another million, according to a person close to the New York senator.\n\nSchumer has been relentless, said a DSCC official.\n\nSchumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them.\n\nLeader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering, McCue said in a statement.\n\nSchumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition.\n\nSchumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats. Schumers colleagues wont rule out the possibility that hell donate more to his partys Senate takeover effort.\n\nIf he thinks it will make a difference, hell do it. Hes very calculating, said a Democratic senator. Chuck will be there if you need him.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more.\n\nHes going to watch everything closely. Its my sense hes 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate, Stabenow said.\n\nTheres no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option.\n\nWere going to make some tough decisions, which havent been made yet, Reid said.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune said hell need to hang on to the rest of his cash.\n\nI dont think I can probably keep pace with Schumer, Thune said in an interview.\n\nRepublicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublicans, however, simply dont have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win.\n\nHes a machine, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner. But it may not make a difference, the Texan added.\n\n\n\nAuthors:'",R

The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.\n\nAnd, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency.\n\nWith four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton\'s way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate.\n\n\n\nHear CNN Political Director David Chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast:\n\nWhat\'s changed?\n\n-- Iowa (6) moves from from ""battleground"" to ""lean Republican""\n\n-- Utah (6) moves from ""lean Republican"" to ""solid Republican""\n\n-- Maine\'s 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground""\n\n-- Nebraska\'s 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground""\n\nRoad to 270: Electoral College map\n\nNote: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.\n\nThe state of play\n\nDonald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up ""battleground"" category into the ""lean Republican"" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.\n\nThat leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina.\n\nMaine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska\'s second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine\'s second congressional district has moved from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" and Nebraska\'s second congressional district has moved from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground,"" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.\n\nFinally, Utah moves back from ""leaning Republican"" to being solidly being in Trump\'s column.\n\nThere is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton\'s firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump\'s path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging.\n\nFor all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton\'s performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton\'s current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump.\n\nIt is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton\'s Democratic leaning firewall.\n\nThat\'s why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that\'s why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we\'ve seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio.\n\nClinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton\'s electoral college advantage holds.\n\nSolid Republican:\n\nAlabama (9), Alaska (3), Arkansas (6), Idaho (4), Indiana (11), Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), Montana (3), Nebraska (4), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (11), Texas (38), Utah (6)West Virginia (5), Wyoming (3) (163 total)\n\nLeans Republican:\n\nArizona (11), Georgia (16), Iowa (6), (33 total)\n\nBattleground states:\n\nFlorida (29), Nevada (6), Ohio (18), Maine 2nd Congressional District (1) Nebraska 2nd Congressional District (1), North Carolina (15) (70 total)\n\nLeans Democratic:\n\nColorado (9), Michigan (16), New Hampshire (4), Pennsylvania (20), Virginia (13), Wisconsin (10), (72 total)\n\nSolid Democratic:\n\nCalifornia (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), DC (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Maine (3), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (29), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3), Washington (12), Minnesota (10), New Mexico (5) (200 total)'",R
"b'Donald Trump Calls for Nationwide Stop-and-Frisk Policy, Then Rolls It Back'","b'As Donald Trump courted African-American voters in Cleveland on Wednesday at a town hall taped by Fox News to air Thursday evening, he seemed to express support for establishing the stop and frisk policing policy on a national level.\n\nWhen asked by an audience member how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump responded, ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive, and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""\n\nHe added, ""New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do.""\n\nThe law enforcement policy  in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed, then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations  has been extremely controversial, particularly in communities of color, and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination. The policy gained prominence in the 1990s under New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now a close confidant of Trump\'s.\n\nTrump previously expressed his support for the policy, praising Giuliani for its success in New York. Trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration, believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism.\n\nHe has drawn the ire of some African-Americans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Trump said, ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they\'ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever""  seeming not to take into account slavery, institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement.\n\nOn Thursday morning, however, in an interview on ""Fox & Friends,"" he sought to amend his position, saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally.\n\n""Now Chicago is out of control. I was referring to Chicago with stop and frisk,"" Trump said.\n\nHis initial answer came in response to a question that did not mention Chicago, though Trump cited the city in a previous answer as a place that is ""out of control.""\n\nOf course, as president, Trump would not be able to unilaterally implement the policy in a single city; he would have to defer to local officials and law enforcement.\n\nDuring a press conference, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus were asked about Trump\'s stop-and-frisk remarks. ""The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous, and Donald trump needs to check his facts,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York.\n\n""We would ask Donald Trump to bone up on his knowledge of what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional,"" said Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-New York.'",R
"b'TRUTH COMES OUT! Keith Lamont Scott\'s Did This To His Wife Last Year and She Said ""He is a Killer""  Freedom Daily'","b'2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nFor the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across Charlotte. The riots are in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. Scotts wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasnt armed and was only carrying a book.\n\nAs usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. There was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on Scotts leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. Those citing this as yet another proof that police are racist should know that the officer who shot Scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting.\n\nAs it turns out, Scott has a history of violence, and theres no reason to think he wouldnt have used his firearm if he had the chance. As Bearing Arms reported:\n\nRakeyia Scotts cry to CMPD officers that her husband, Keith Lamont Scott, did not own a guneven as he brandished a gun in front of themnow appears to be a calculated lie, according to Rakeyia Scott. On Oct. 5, a Gaston County District Court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. The court order told Scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the childrens schools. He was not allowed near their Gastonia apartment theyd called home since April 2014, according to court documents. He was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. Eleven days later, Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, He is no longer a threat to me and my family. But three days before she got the order, Keith Scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. He said he is a killer and we should know that, she wrote. She said the man shed been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from April 2004 to April 2011. She checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before.\n\nThe Scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by Scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. Yeah  OK.\n\nScotts wife told officers he didnt own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that couldve gotten them killed. While rioters destroy Charlotte, theyre doing so over a man who couldve killed those officers, and had a wife that he himself once threatened wouldve been an accomplice to their murders.'",R
"b""'Locked the black bitch out': White students under investigation after racist Snapchat reveals campus harassment""","b'The University of North Dakota is investigating a racist social media post that apparently shows white students locking a black student out of her own dorm room.\r\n\r\nIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, student Etonde Maloke shared a photo of three white female students laughing in a dorm room. The photo includes the caption, Locked the black bitch out.\r\n\r\nMy friend left her phone in her room and the three kids pictured below took her phone and took the snapchat pictured below, Maloke wrote. They captioned it locked the black bitch out. My friend was not aware that they had done this and didnt even realize they had put this on her snapchat story until another friend of ours pointed it out.\r\n\r\nWe all know Racism is alive and well (whether you like to admit it not), she bemoaned. When said acts of racism happen at your school, it is infuriating and heart breaking.\r\n\r\nThe university later released a statement on Twitter addressing the incident.\r\n\r\nWhat is portrayed is not part of the community values that we expound, the statement said. We take seriously issues related to respect for all.'",R
